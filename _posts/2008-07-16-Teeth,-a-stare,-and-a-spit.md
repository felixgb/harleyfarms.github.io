Teeth that could star in Pirates of the Caribbean, a stare to match
your mother's, and a malevolent spit?







The next couple of llamas came five years ago. They were show animals,
so rather better looking than Bart, in llama circles. All three are
working animals, not toys. A dog escaped onto the pasture last
February, but the llamas immediately herded the goats behind them, and
stood three in a line between the dog and the goats. They spit and
kick viciously in defense of their herd and territory.

Bad cop

We have five llamas now, two with the non-milking herd over the road.
Their stand-offish, efficient personalities, and the way they move,
are perfect. No more llamas, though, thank you.
