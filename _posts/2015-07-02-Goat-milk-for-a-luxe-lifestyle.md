Goat milk is superlative for your skin, a natural combination of
vitamins, minerals, alpha-hydroxy acid and essential fatty acids. Our
Bath and Body Collection is supremely delicate, effective and wholly
natural, ideal  protection from age and the environment. This is
serious luxury:  world-class effective ingredients, hand-made with a
sustainable harvest  in mind.

Well, a luxury product deserves a luxurious home. We are naturally
thrilled to now feature in the world-class Ritz-Carlton Spa, Half Moon
Bay.

Our best-selling goat milk soap is aged for a premium bar that keeps
its shape and delicate aroma of lavender, rose geranium or lemon
verbena. We also make unscented soap and a masculine blend of citrus
and spice. Try goat milk soap in the shower every day for noticably
softer skin
