Sarah Wool is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wool, who shear our llamas,
and most of the neighborhood's llamas and alpacas, every year. She was
here with her dad helping out earlier this year. Sarah grew up with
animals on their San Jose property, and plans a career in agribusiness
- not with animals, but with plants, which involve less emotional
involvement! She's supplementing her CalPoly student income with these
gorgeous full-of-personality woolly llamas, for sale in our farm shop.

Sarah's llamas are Scottish Blackface sheep and mohair goat wool - the
mohair gives the gorgeous curly bodies

Llama &quot;wool&quot; is actually fibers rather than wool - hollow,
with no lanolin. The outer coat fibers, or guard hair, are stiff and
tricky to comb out from the fleece, so mohair and sheep wool were a
much cuddlier choice for these mini llamas
