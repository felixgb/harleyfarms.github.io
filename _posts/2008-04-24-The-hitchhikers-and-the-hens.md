Thank you to all our visitors who've admired the chicken tractors. Our
hens are comfortable and our Alpine goats love the climbing in our
flat fields. They were the inspired design of our long-time friend
TFB, but built by two German Journeymen. We wrote about this at the
time, but it's such a serendipitous story we'll tell it again. Our
photographer, Paolo, picked up two oddball hitchhikers on his way to
drop off some photos at the farm. At first sight we thought they might
be mariachi men, but they were actually apprentice carpenters
traveling through Canada down the west coast into Mexico with little
more than their tools, although those had been confiscated at the
US/Canadian customs. Journeymen spend at least two years practicing
their trade, paid by the day, and these were the traveling sort. Well,
they stayed for two weeks, borrowed some tools, built our excellent
prototype chicken tractor, and went on their way to Mexico. We'd love
to know where they stopped off next. Did they build more chicken
houses? Let us know.
