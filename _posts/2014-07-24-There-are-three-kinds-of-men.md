There are three kinds of men

The ones that learn by reading. The few who learn by observation. The
rest of them have to pee on the electric fence for themselves. Will
Rogers

but only one kind of goat

The kind that escapes through old fences.

It's new fence time! Here's the pasture in front of the dairy, with
the goats in the corral, marked off with this post and cord into our
new arrangement of separate paddocks for the goats. We will rotate the
goats from space to space, to preserve the grasses. There'll be a
pathway around the whole, and a lane through the middle of the field
to herd them from the loafing barn to the paddocks. (Yes - we will
have electric fencing to prevent the goats chewing on the wood posts
and pushing and scratching against the fence until it breaks, but they
are girls, and won't be peeing on the electric fence.)

Can't wait for our new gates, Brian! Thanks!
