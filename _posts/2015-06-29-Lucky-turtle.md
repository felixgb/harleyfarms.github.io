Adriana was on her way to the farm, and just south of Half Moon Bay,
when she spotted a turtle in the opposing lane of the highway. There
was no way that turtle would make it across the road unharmed. Adriana
made a quick u-turn and pulled over. She stepped out into the road and
stopped the traffic. A trucker saw what was happening and took over
the traffic. Another guy stepped out and said he was from the Ag Board
and could take care of the turtle. Adriana said she was from Harley
Farms and could take care of the turtle. They high-fived and then
Adriana tucked the slider into her car and came on into work.

The turtle is a red eared slider, which are non-native and displace
earlier species in the wild. After making it comfortable with some
water and lettuce, we had to find it a safe habitat. We couldn't
release it in the marsh, so we asked our Facebook readers for a foster
home. There were several generous offers, and it went home with our
Pescadero neighbor Nancy Raulston. Thank you Nancy!

Pescadero's Root Down Farm brought us twenty Delaware hens, in a nice
surprise for the rooster. They are the white with a touch of black
chickens: a calm and friendly breed that lays plenty of eggs.

Also last week, we welcomed Joyce Bittner, visiting from her goat
dairy farm in Arizona, Fossil Creek Creamery. General manager Lesa and
I have been working with the Bittners on expanding and strengthening
their products and events for almost two years. Joyce spent a morning
in the dairy with Salud making ricotta, and an evening with Eil√≠s
making goat milk soap. It was a pleasure to host Joyce and I am
looking forward to hearing back from her and her husband John.

Joyce views the feeding routine and the milking parlor. They raise
Nubians, the breed with the highly attractive pendulous ears. Nubians
are comfortable in Arizona summers - Joyce found the weather here on
the coast chilly, though it was an extremely warm day.
