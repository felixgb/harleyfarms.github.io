Yesterday our 2011 American Alpine babies crossed the road from their
juvenile paddock back home to the farm, with their llamas Dolly and
Lorenzo. Every baby was born on the farm this spring, named and tagged
so that we have a record of her pedigree. The babies were raised in
small groups on our annex before being set loose on their first grass
paddock. Now, at 90lb or more each, they are sturdy goats ready to
meet boyfriend Holstein.

What's the plan?! Let's hold up the school bus, the beer truck, and a
bunch of local vehicles
