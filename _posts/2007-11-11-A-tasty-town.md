That's my accountant on the right, laughing

When I taste our cheese, I know it flaunts our hundred-year-old
pastures and the brisk saltiness of the winds off the Pacific, but I'd
go further. The French word terroir, about how wine or food expresses
the region in which it is made, is all-encompassing: you can taste
soil, climate, culture and tradition. And we've got such a tasty town
here!

We took a break on Wednesday to watch the town Halloween parade. The
sheriffs close the street, there's a stream of witches and devils and
ghouls from the local school, all the businesses bring out candy, and
the local park ranger always takes the day off to appear in elaborate
disguise. It's small-town nirvana.

Of course, when I was seventeen I couldn't wait to run from my
parents' small town, but now I appreciate the quirkiness and the
conviviality of tradition. We have a vibrant farming community, and
you taste that in our cheese.

I have my parents' neighbor Tony here for a month ' though he could
probably stay for years given the dollar to sterling exchange rate.
It's always fun showing visitors around, and he has milked,
pasteurized, and painted the barn with our new goat milk paint. He
even likes the cheese!
