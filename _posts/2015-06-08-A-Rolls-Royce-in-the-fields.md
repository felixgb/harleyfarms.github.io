It's June. Wedding season is open. And it's also the season for
driving Rolls-Royces through farm fields.

An elaborate altar of flowers for your wedding is optional - but
irresistible. Lindsay and Garrett chose a classically romantic yet
wild combination of colors and shapes - we have a handful of mature
gardens and generous gardeners here in Pescadero with wonderful
texture and bloom

Floral designer Karolynne Meyer pinned succulents one by one to anchor
this wispily romantic collection of love in a mist, hydrangea,
eucalyptus, amaranthus and anthriscus

Our own Adriana is licensed to marry you and conducted the ceremony

Our lavish flower arrangements at the red Upper Barn

The front room at the Upper Barn is a staff favorite for parties

We tucked these two girls into the tiny stable at the barn - the baby
on the right is peeping into the party room

Luxury amid the gloriousness of our valley

Lindsay's mother walked her down the aisle

After the ceremony, guests walked over the fields to the Upper Barn -
some, enchantingly, barefoot

but this time the groom got a ride

All three so photogenic

That's a Lindsay's Blue Moon

At the back of the barn you can just see the wedding cake

which Karolynne made even prettier

May the rest of your days be as wildly romantic as this evening
