and you will never see the shadow

If we seem to tell you the trivial news each month - the limping baby
goat, the latest elderly adopted labrador, the fat cats and their
trophy mice - it's because laughing over light-hearted farm gossip and
small endeavors like nursing Sunshine the baby goat is the best way to
get through the physical and mental effort of the farm at this time of
year. Almost all of the blue tag herd have had their babies. We milked
the mothers by hand to save their colostrum milk for the babies, who
were bottle-fed before they learnt to suckle on buckets with teats.
Now we have to keep the babies warm and dry with plenty of play space,
and can milk the mothers in the parlor, beginning the cycle of milking
and cheesemaking that goes on for the rest of the year. Every action
has to be on time, and carried out with care and respect for animals
and staff.

This was Sunshine, who was born blind in one eye and could take only a
few steps at a time. She got a lot of attention on the farm in her few
days of life, because it was a joy to focus on a single happy event,
like cuddling Sunshine outside in the sun, seeing her respond to the
warmth and the bleats of the newborns outside in the nearby pen. But
Sunshine didn't grow stronger, and died last week. It's hard for those
who helped us with her care, but who weren't bound up in the day to
day efforts of the farm and whose experience of her death was perhaps
more upsetting because it wasn't balanced by farm work. Not all of our
stories have a happy ending.
