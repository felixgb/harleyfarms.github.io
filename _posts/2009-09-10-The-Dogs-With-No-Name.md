It is a year last week that Foxi arrived at the farm. Foxi died
suddenly, but peacefully, in the summer, and is buried underneath a
lilac in the garden. We miss her ridiculous panting and happiness so
much.

For Foxi

The black dogs on our farm are always elderly, rescued dogs. They nap
in the shrubbery and don't chase the chickens. We miss them bitterly
when they die. But this is an idyllic home for dogs, and our new black
dogs are here. They are 10 years old, and have no names.

I met their owner at Crissy Field in the early summer. She loved them
but had lost her home, and called Rocket Dog Rescue.

The Dogs with No Name patrol the fenceline of the garden, but like
their distance. She will wag her tail for you, but he is shy and may
not come out from underneath the roses.

Foxi's rescuer visits to walk the new black dogs a little way up the
road, before they get tired and need to return for their naps in the
shrubbery.
