It's not new. It's an old barn, twenty years or more older than ours,
in the fields south of the farm. Last Friday evening we walked into
our pastures to say goodbye to Cadbury, the oldest goat on the farm
and son of Sugar Magnolia, one of my original six pet goats. Cadbury
died quietly and is buried in our fields close to his mother. He was
born the year before my son, and so I shared photographs of them
walking up the street, and climbing down to the beach, together. I
didn't know I would cry, but it was a momentous goodbye, because
Cadbury died on the evening we exchanged contracts for the neighboring
fields and barn. The end of our beginning, the beginning of our
future.
