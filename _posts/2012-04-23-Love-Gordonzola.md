Gordon Edgar was the voice on the telephone from Rainbow Grocery.
Rainbow is a workers' cooperative that grew from a San Francisco
ashram's food-buying club in 1975. If you have food-loving family in
from out of town, Rainbow is a fascinating stop on a tour of foodie
San Francisco. Practically all online reviewers ooze praise of the
opulent cheese selection, which is Gordon's department. Your visitors
will also enjoy the astonishing bulk foods, plus the occasional mob
lynching of SUVs in the car park (leave yours a couple of streets
away) and the European egalitarianism of packing your own bags at
check-out.

I met Gordon face to face at one of the American Cheese Society
competitions. In a distinguished cheese career, that began long before
cheese careers were trending, he has judged and written about American
cheeses with flair and humor. He makes me laugh and I trust his advice
on cheese and selling cheese. Plus I love it when we can't make it to
a cheese show, but Gordon will be there and if we've won an award,
he'll collect it for us and bring it to the farm with fanfare!

I am both proud and humble to announce cheese classes with Gordon at
Harley Farms. The first class, on farmstead cheeses, is on Monday May
28th. Your chance to meet Gordon, one of my cheese heros.
