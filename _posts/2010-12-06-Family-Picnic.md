The goats are visibly pregnant now, we're shipping exciting parcels of
cheese all over the country, and our Christmas Faire is next weekend.
These are the usual routines of our farm and business. For all the
routines of summer - such as the hauling of the irrigating pipes
across the pastures - there are corresponding jobs in winter - regular
mucking-out of the straw in the loafing barn, as the waddling goats
spend more time indoors. But we also have the routines of a family,
the traditions that bind us as a group. So, December 1st was our
annual picnic at our neighbor Sande's house, up in the hills of
Pescadero. Her garden's a mass of Christmas trees jostling for
sunlight, needing a man with a saw. We thin out a few, and dress the
barn and shop for their most beautiful appearance of the year.
