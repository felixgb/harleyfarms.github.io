We've written about our dream of a Harley Herd of weedbusting goats.
Your weeds are their lunch. Goats prefer blackberry bushes, Canada
thistle, poison oak and even poison hemlock to their usual pasture
grasses, making them a natural part of land management. Now we're
looking for the extraordinarily patient individual who'll manage the
Harley Herd.

You'll have a basic understanding of the botany of both weeds and
desirable plants, so that you'll know when to introduce the herd.
You'll have empathy with the goat hierachies: control the boss goat
and thus the herd. Work with the herd dog. You'll decide how many
goats to introduce, and how you'll keep them on the property. Optimal
land management involves seasonal or annual control: you'll seek
public and private land contracts, keep detailed records of projects,
and make pricing decisions. And you'll have the patience of a
shepherd!

You'll work with Harley Farms, county Sustainable Business of the
Year. We seek integrity and commitment to community, and we look
forward to hearing from you!
