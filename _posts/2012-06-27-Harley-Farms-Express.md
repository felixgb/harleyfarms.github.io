It's the end of baby season. All the 2012 babies are weaned from milk
to nutritionally appropriate grain. The younger group of babies, whose
mothers are last year's babies, will be leaving the farm soon.

Our latest rescue dog, George the beagle, is still cautious and will
take some time to relax into his farm life. He was a subject for
medical testing, but is healthy and should have a happy beagle life

We all enjoyed our glimpse of Friday night's wedding on the farm.
Adriana has her wedding officiant license, so that we are a one-stop
shop for wedding ceremonies! We'll never forget that the bride wore
red wellies under her wedding gown for a romantic but practical farm
tour

We're well into a busy summer season, with the launch of a new aged
cheese, our new goat milk paint range, and more cheese classes coming.
Move over - we're the Harley Farms Express!
