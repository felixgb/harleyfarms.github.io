Each December we take the flatbed truck into the hills to thin my
friend Sande's woods. It was misty and damp this year, with the wind
in the trees. This is one of my own Christmas rituals, brought
straight to mind with the scent of freshly cut pine. Roberto climbs
the bank with the chainsaw, and the rest of us haul the trees to the
truck. They are lovely without decoration, though we do hang lights
and carved goats on some, and they will scent the farm Christmas fete
this weekend.
