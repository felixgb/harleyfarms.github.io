I am especially proud to be President of Pescadero High School Viking
Boosters this year. The farm dominates the committee: Sharina is
Secretary and Kim Hussey, who leads farm tours, is Vice-President. The
Boosters funds the high school sports teams

Ryan, with high school student help, renovated and painted the Snack
Shack. The students, though, must own it. Everybody will sign up for a
maintenance task around school; everybody will bring a donation of $10
three times a year

The Vikings. Open for Business!
