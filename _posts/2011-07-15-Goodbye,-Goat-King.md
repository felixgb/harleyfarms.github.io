Our farm manager of four great years left today, for travel,
relaxation and a new job. Heartfelt thanks and best wishes to Ryan and
Annie. Ryan leaves behind this and last year's healthy herds of baby
goats, his legacy to the farm. We are stronger than ever before thanks
to his passion and commitment. Truly the Goat King.
