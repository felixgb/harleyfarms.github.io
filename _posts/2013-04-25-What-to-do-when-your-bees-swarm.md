Bee swarms, where the old queen and about half a colony leave a hive
looking for a new home, are common in spring. If you or neighbors have
bees, expect to see clusters of bees a few hundred yards from the old
hive. The cluster is the departed group, hanging together, usually in
a tree, waiting for the scout bees to lead them to a suitable new
home. This is the best time to collect and rehouse the swarm.

Bee clusters in one of our old apple trees, waiting for their scouts
to find a new home. Thankfully apple trees are easy to climb. Tell
your beekeeper if they need to bring a ladder!

Swarming bees, especially in northern California, where they are
likely to be mild-mannered European honey bees, are docile unless
provoked, so don't panic if a mass of bees hums past you. They are not
protecting their brood, as they would in a hive, and they are not yet
hungry.

The scout bees are looking for a secure cavity of between six and ten
gallons, with an entrance ideally about ten feet from the ground, such
as a hollow tree. They will be attracted by buildings in poor repair -
if they set up house in one of your outbuildings, you will need to
find an experienced beebuster. Search online for a local beekeeper,
looking for those who collect and  rehouse swarms. County agricultural
offices may be able to help. Do not be tempted by the cheaper option
of killing the bees, because the huge mass of bees, comb and honey
will rot through your drywall, causing considerable structural damage.
An experienced beekeeper will clean the area thoroughly so that no
beeswax remains, attracting future bee scouts looking for a home. And
fix that entrance hole!
