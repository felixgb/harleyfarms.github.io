Farm life: mud, afterbirth, curds and whey … and beautiful girls.
San Francisco photographer Michele Clement took a series of
“naturalistic” fashion portraits on the farm a few days ago. The
models were ivory and diaphanous like slivers of parmigiano on the

naturalistically across the farm. Ryan and Luis took several “short-
cuts” outside to gaze back.
