All things are fleeting, the Buddha said. Like the seasons, everything
changes. Appreciate the pleasures of the moment, for that is of real
value. Walking our beagle George through the field of mustard
blossoms, hearing the bleat of babies on the farm, it's easy to be
happy in the moment. It's springtime.

The farm staff love the black and white babies this year! Previously,
neither father was black and white. These are new buck Holstein's
babies

Seasonal cheese. We make ricotta with fresh milk only, never frozen.
So there isn't any ricotta in late winter because the goats are
pregnant. If you've never had still-warm ricotta fresh from the dairy,
come now!
