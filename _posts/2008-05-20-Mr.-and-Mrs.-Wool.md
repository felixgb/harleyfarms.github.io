Thanks to Tony for the photo

The farm was action-packed this week. We hosted the local garden
tour's reception, and held our Mother's Day lunch, so the gardens and
shop had to look extra-gorgeous, even in the heat. Luckily for the
sheep, they'd been sheared a couple of days before it got really hot!
And no kidding, our shearers really do have the perfect last name.
