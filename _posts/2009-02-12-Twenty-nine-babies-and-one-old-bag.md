It's been a productive morning. Fourteen babies arrived last night,
bringing our total up to 29 - one mother had quadruplets! Also, I made
a chocolate birthday cake from scratch for our lovely, youthful office
manager Sharina.

Surprise!

I could probably be a professional baker, don't you think?

Only thirty-threeâ€¦

We bred the goats early, so the babies have started arriving. The
newborn families are separated from the lively week-old babies, and
just-about-to-give-birth mothers. We'll have a very noisy barnful of
pregnant and nursing goats over this rainy weekend!

Tours begin in February, so do come and admire the babies soon.
