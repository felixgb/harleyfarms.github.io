We are immensely touched by the response to our call for a shepherd.
Engineers, teachers, a professional cyclist, several chefs, many
musicians, and, most enchantingly, a poet were among those of you who
were interested in weeding goats. Many of you declared your love of
animals, others pointed out that their experience herding children
would certainly help with goats. Chefs were intrigued by the position,
but only goats will be doing the eating. There would be time to
compose, but your music might have to play second fiddle to wandering
weed-eaters..

The Harley Herd shepherd will run the weeding flock as a separate
business within our dairy business, generating their own income. We
will trial the weedbusting this year, and add retiring milking goats
next year.

Thank you to everybody who was interested. We're sorry not to
interview all the exceptional people who applied, but welcome you to
the farm soon.
