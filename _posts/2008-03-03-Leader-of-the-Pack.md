About this time of year, I have to call my mother. 'Lisa's in labor!'?
Four years ago, we had to call the veterinarian for an emergency
Caesarian birth. Lisa, named for the vet, was such a sickly baby goat
we couldn't take her horns off, as we usually do. My mother, visiting
from Yorkshire, raised the pathetic Lisa lovingly, to become our most
bossy, dominant goat, now with the status of a favorite child. There
are framed pictures of Lisa in my mother's house...

Anyhow, Lisa's had her babies this year. The mothers usually give
birth close to the herd, but Lisa demands that we get into the pen
too. She'll wait uncomfortably until we've climbed over into the pen
with the rest of the herd.

There are late nights at birthing season, but luckily we have Andrew
and Griff on the farm. They are actually fabulous designer/architect
people, here from London to transform our house, but instead of
drawing up plans they are rolling up their cashmere sleeves for the
birth of baby goat after baby goat, or ransacking the edible garden
for our chicken eggs, or cooking us dinner while we wash off the
afterbirth. It should all lead to an amazing understanding of the
perfect farmhouse. Including more framed photographs of Lisa.
