who swallowed a fly

![image](/img/news/125_bats.JPG)

If you know this old lady, kindly mention that we have some flies for
her. We have over two hundred goats, all of whom defecate. House flies
are keen to feed on warm, rotting organic matter such as goat manure,
and apparently a pair of flies can produce over a million new flies in
two months. There are sensible precautions. We keep screens on windows
and doors, and rubbish bins shut. We collect goat manure and cover it
while the heap decomposes into valuable garden mulch. However, there
are thousands of flies to suppress, and we have a multipronged attack
plan. You might have noticed plastic bags mounted on our outside
walls, of dubious appearance. They contain a liquid irresistible but
deadly to flies. We have also built bat boxes, in the hope of bat
tenants moving onto the farm. Starting at dusk, bats will eat hundreds
of flying insects every night, including mosquitoes and flies. It only
remains to find the old lady, and we won't let her swallow the horses.
