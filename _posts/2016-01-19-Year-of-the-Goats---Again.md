The Chinese New Year next month ushers in the Year of the Monkey. Our
2015 Year of the Goat brought us a herd in excellent health, even more
fertile pastures, and re-roofed and ventilated barns. We gained our
farm manager, Mark. We lost people we loved, but we have deep, happy
memories and we celebrated their lives together. And there's new life
to come. Adriana's Farm Baby will have a sister. And two hundred kids
arrive in spring as ever. So, for us, it's another Year of the Goats -
and Llamas.

It's quite miserable outside, but that's a good thing. We need to take
the time to cocoon, since there's only a month until kidding season
begins. The trees are bare and there's mud underfoot, but the pasture
is a deep green, thanks to the rain. Satisfyingly, the fertilizer and
organic manure spread in November will be going to work, making the
spring grass even more nutritious.

Romantically, we've held two January weddings, both on days of winter
sunshine, with a bonfire and sheepskin and felted throws in the upper
barn.
