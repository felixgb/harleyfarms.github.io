The farm shop tables, waiting to be re-oiled

Happy New Year! We've had a busy two weeks planting garlic for the
2010 farm dinners, and spring cleaning the shop and hayloft. We oiled
the tables and floor (a thank you to Ryan's friend Adam!) and
repainted the walls and stairs. The chicken tractors are out of the
pastures , sheltering near the chicken coop, so that newly seeded
grass can mature without our muddy footsteps. And we're planning
irrigation in the south field, which involves an exciting tunnel under
the road.
