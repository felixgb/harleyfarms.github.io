Imagine a group of girlfriends, years back, when they were even
younger than they are now. They're passionate and dynamic, they're all
in the food and wine business… It's the American Cheese Society
awards, in Vermont, and it's been a long, successful day. They've
partied all evening, they're tottering down the hotel corridor, and
now Kristin, the witty Wholefoods buyer from Minneapolis, must make a
decision… Will she or won't she knock on the door of Bob, the
charming wine merchant?

Flash forward twelve years (but everybody still looks good) to the pop
of a champagne cork. It's Kristin and Bob's place in Las Vegas. She
knew cheese and he knew wine: a match made in heaven, but helped by
me…. They sold everything and moved west, to open their gorgeous
gourmet shop. We had a few days with them earlier in the summer, with
some pool and poker in Vegas, and I had to congratulate myself on the
amazingly successful partnership of two funny, hardworking, delightful
people!

I do the matchmaking, and Elvis does the marrying.
