&quot;Bart was the highlight&quot;

&quot;My sister and I were just talking about Bart&quot;

&quot;We have... stories about Bart... during our commuting time&quot;

&quot;He will be remembered forever in that painting... about him
conducting the farm&quot;

Thank you to everybody who wrote or came to our memorial for Bart, our
iconic llama, who died in the first week of January aged about 28
years. We name only a few animals. We are farmers, not pet owners.
Animals are born and animals die every year on the farm. Bart was
nonetheless a legend for our family and countless visitors, with his
evident pleasure in guarding the baby goats, his occasional close-up-
and-personal inspection of somebody with scented shampoo, and his
unforgettable teeth!

Friends brought photographs and laughed at our slideshow of Bart
moments. We were gently serenaded by Mike McCall and soothed into
reflection with the debut performance of the Harley Farmonica Band.
Our magnificent cook produced lunch (and thank you to those who
brought dishes with them). We scattered grass seed over the Heart of
Bart, his resting place in the pasture overseeing the babies. Goodbyes
are an opportunity for happy memories, for gentle thought outside the
rush of life.
