It is my passion to use our farm raw materials in as many creative
ways as possible. My long-time friend, folk artist Three Finger Bil,
has for a decade painted our carved signs in his own goat milk paint.

This summer we finished perfecting that recipe with Alex Warren of
Sinopia in San Francisco. Alex is a pigment hunter, a man whose nose
tingles when he sees an unusual shade on a painting, or a wall,
anywhere in the world.

Alex added natural pigments, new and ancient, and took our farm paint
recipe to the point where we can now offer you glorious natural colors
in the classic matte of milk paint. It's creamy, velvety rich, and
ready to use straight out of the jar, inside or outside your house.
And it's so gentle you could eat it.

Have a look at the walls and furniture in our new barn shop of dry
goods to see our colors. You can shop for farm paint now in our barn,
