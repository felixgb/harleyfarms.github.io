The farm has fizzing energy and camaraderie this August! We have
several new employees, and this next weekend will toast our purchase
of the neighboring acres and barn with all the staff. Our new
generation is the younger staff. Like all the Pescadero businesses, we
have work for young people in the community, and I am especially happy
to train teenagers who return each summer or work part-time during the
school year. They become an asset to the farm, and they develop ties
to our community that give them extra self-confidence, skills and a
salary, irrespective of their family background or school performance.

Yesterday, Ben and David stepped up to the mic to present the
Pescadero Art and Fun Festival SCCS Fashion Show. They were even
better than the previous presenters. Out with the old and in with the
new!

The Pescadero Art and Fun Fair is an annual fundraiser for art in our
local schools. If you've ever sat and listened to the amazing variety
of talented musicians who play here every year - the mariachi band are
now the children of the original musicians! - you cannot help but be
impressed by the breadth of talent and kindness in our community. It's
a good place to grow up and I look forward to all our new generations
of staff and neighbors
