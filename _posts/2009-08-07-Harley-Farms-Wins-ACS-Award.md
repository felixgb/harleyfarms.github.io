We are very happy to announce that Harley Farms has won 1st Place for
our Plain Chevre Log in the Fresh Goat's Milk Cheeses category at the
2009 the American Cheese Society Award in Austin, Texas.  We also
took 2nd Place in the Cultured Products Made from Goat's Milk category

cheese was received at the ACS awards and we look forward to next year
