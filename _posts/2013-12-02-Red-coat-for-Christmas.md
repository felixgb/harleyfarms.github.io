David just got back from South America. He worked on a Peruvian quinoa
farm translating and delivering, and then took buses through Bolivia,
Chile and Argentina. Haggling down the gringo prices was good for his
Spanish. He loved the street food, but &quot;it didn't love me&quot;.
Now, get back to work.
