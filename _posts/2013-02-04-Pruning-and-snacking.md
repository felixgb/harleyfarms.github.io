The neglected apples and pears in the old orchard were heavy with
fruit last year, but badly needed pruning to thin out the canopy and
increase the quality and sweetness of the fruit. Hoping that frosts
are over, we've pruned the orchard this week, making huge heaps of
wood for chipping. We will use the fruit for autumn farm dinners and
preserves, but most will go to the local restaurant.
