The weekend storms blew off a barn door, soaked the pastures and
garden to a rich squelchy mud, and brought thirty babies into the
world. We expect more births in bad weather; our neighbors the Moores
always had more calves on stormy nights. These are our yearlings'
babies, and their mothers are a little surprised at their
accomplishments. They look around for Ryan's support, and will follow
him about the loafing barn anxiously, abandoning their newborn in a
corner. They resist hand-milking, and kick up a petulant fuss in the
milking parlor. Next year, they will be placid know-it-alls.

She knows I'm not Ryan, who hand-reared her last spring

The babies have plenty of warm straw and luxury housing
