The milking herd at breakfast. It's time to prepare for breeding. It
seems only a few weeks ago that they were pregnant - but they have had
a long summer of good health and frequent check-ups, plenty to eat,
excellent weather, and irrigated pasture. The second week of
September, we will introduce the bucks again, with the first babies
due in February.

The babies are slender young goats now, and most will be ready to
breed in late fall.

Mark and Ben have been trimming hooves this week. If the goats were
feral, they would wear down the unnecessary growth as they foraged
over distance. We don't have sufficient hard surface for that to
happen on the farm.

road where we keep the non-milking goats.

The bucks are returning to the &quot;Buck Pen&quot; where Rosie the
donkey lives, so that the milkers and the males can smell each other
through the fence for a month, stimulating hormones in preparation for
breeding. Here the girls are following them, though perhaps just in
curiosity. We expect plenty of tail-wagging and more vocalizations as
the girls become interested.

Coltrane is a polled goat, born without horns. Goat horns contain
large blood vessels, a plus in hot climates with little shade. Here,
though, it's rarely hot enough to trouble the goats, and horns are a
liability in close quarters. Horned goats would snag themselves in
fencing, or hurt each other and perhaps us and visitors too. However,
polled goats have a drawback for us, in that the gene is associated
with hermaphroditism. About one in eight births to a polled parent may
be a sterile hermaphrodite, with both sex organs. You can't milk those
babies.

The bucks will feed inside the shelter, so that Rosie can't eat all
their food. Poor Rosie. She needs to lose weight. We'll see whether
she likes the male company.
