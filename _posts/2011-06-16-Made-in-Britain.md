Upon the funeral of their adored dog of 17 years, my old friends
Andrew and Griff are in town to open up our shop to a cornucopia of
clothes and textiles, hand-made in Britain for Harley Farms. Our
&quot;Made in Britain&quot; lines will be a tempting mix of the
practical and decorative, with clogs for women and children and
Shetland wool hats already available for you to try. But first, please
consider Andrew and Griff's loss.

Andrew and Griff's Piglet, adopted 17 years ago from a London pound,
died peacefully last month

I remember an awful incident a year or so ago when we were all on
holiday in Yorkshire. Piglet, let out last thing in the evening for a
little fresh air, wandered off, perhaps confused by the countryside.
Andrew and Griff leapt to the dramatic conclusion that she had been
squashed on the local railway, but very happily she reappeared in the
morning on the milkman's truck, having been spotted trotting along the
lanes. She lived another few months of her very long life.

You may be a fashion buyer, but we will still make you work on the
farm. Griff wrangles a frisky llama

We quite often feature our dead pets. It may be a way of dealing with
the emotional tumult of being responsible for the welfare of animals
and staff on the farm. An official farewell ends an exhausting season
of work or an unusual week of incident. And happy times are ahead! We
welcome you to the farm in summer for a relaxing day out or a farm
dinner upstairs. Do stop by the farm shop to admire Andrew and Griff's
design work and lovely new hand-made things for you and your family.
