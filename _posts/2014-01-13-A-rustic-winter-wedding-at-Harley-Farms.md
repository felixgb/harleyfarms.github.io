Between us at Harley Farms, we've had every kind of wedding, from
ritzy to the back yard, from fabulously styled to secret registry
office. I won't tell you about mine - I wish we'd had the farm then! I
have been married for almost twenty-five years. It doesn't stop me
from becoming ridiculously romantic about each and every wedding we
host here on the farm. Last Saturday was a January wedding for a
gorgeous couple who chose a rustic ceremony in our woodland gardens,
followed by an evening feast in the hayloft.

We make all flower arrangements for our farm weddings from seasonal
blossom and foliage here in Pescadero, to complement the naturally
rustic surroundings. Here are our winter wedding flowers for this
stunning couple.

The flower diadems were specially commissioned for the wedding

The bride's bouquet is the soft green of Corsican hellebores (lenten
roses) with curly willow

We pinned matching corsages and boutonnieres to the wedding guests
around the bonfire, before the ceremony

Farm office manager Adriana can marry you, if you would like a civil
ceremony

Adriana does not usually carry a knife at ceremonies. Only if the
rings get trapped in the lining of your jacket!
