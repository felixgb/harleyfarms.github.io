We're a month back from Yorkshire, and I'd like to report that British
men are looking good! They were wrapped in chic cardigans and scarfs,
shoes polished and witty charm on full blast. Of course, my husband
has nothing to fear. He keeps a closet of clothes at my parents'
house: wet weather things and tennis whites acquired fifteen years ago
at Pescadero's thrift shop. A fine establishment, and naturally my
husband looks very fine, as you'll notice from the photo.

You can't have everything - slick cardigans, witty charm, ready
cash… - but I have got the most wonderful cook. Our New Year's Eve
feast was pheasant and goose, prepared by my husband with assistant
son and nephew. We ordered the birds from the extremely well-supported
local farm shops in Yorkshire. Most people shop locally in the
country; each small town might have three or four butchers, each with
their own specialty sausages, for example.

I love the festivities and routines of Christmas in Yorkshire. It's
both a fizzingly exciting whirl of cooking and singing and cold
weather and everybody off work, and a recharging, peaceful reassurance
of the pleasures of childhood. On New Year's Eve, we had cocktails and
canapes at my parents', moved on to neighbors, and ended up at Tony's
house, dinner having being cooked in three ovens in three different
houses. There were millions of candles, Andrew and Griff brought
Andrew's famous amaretto trifle, and we ended up with two hours of
fireworks in the freezing night.

Tony was away, with family in the Lake District, so he couldn't see
the party devastation of his house. The very last wine glass was put
away as he returned the next day.. Here's to 2009!
