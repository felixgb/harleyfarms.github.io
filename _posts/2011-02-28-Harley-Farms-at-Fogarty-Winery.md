Our afternoon of farm food and local wines at the spectacular Fogarty
Winery was glorious, thanks to the generosity of everyone who came out
on a snowy Saturday to taste, to pour wine, to cook and to cuddle our
three traveling baby goats. The event will support the La Honda-
Pescadero School District, where our son and almost all our younger
staff are students or alumni.
