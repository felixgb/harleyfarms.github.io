We have the first five babies in the loafing barn. They are delicate
but robust, tiny long-legged things dancing sideways, already looking
around for the other babies, collapsing together against the walls in
sleep. We get to know these babies well because there are only a few.

This baby is three hours old here. You can see her damp tail still
curled up over her back. She's tall and sturdy - a singleton, she got
all her mother's resources.

This baby is already supremely independent, apart from her love for
Roberto. Her mother rejected her - another mother licked her first,
and so she smelt wrong to her birth mother, who wouldn't have anything
to do with her. Roberto has bottle-fed her the mother's colostrum
milk. If she stays on the farm, this baby will forever recognize
Roberto as her mother-figure

This just-born baby took ten minutes snuffling her mother to find the
colostrum milk

The babies cuddle together against the barn walls, though the bigger
goats will not deliberately trample them
