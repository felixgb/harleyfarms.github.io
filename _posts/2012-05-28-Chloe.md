I wish we had collected photos of Chloe for every year she's worked at
the farm, starting with one weekend day in eighth grade, but here's
something typical from this year, now that she runs tours, trains shop
staff, owns a pasteurization license and is an all-round farm girl,
not to mention her nursing career.

Chloe is an athlete - she has always understood working hard,
reliability, teamwork and being funny. She is competent and kind to
animals, but not sentimental. She is adored by our cheesemaking and
farm staff alike, not least for her broad understanding of Spanish
idiom. When she started here, she was shy. Now we can't get her away
from visitors. We are so proud of our local staff, and Chloe is a
stellar example of somebody who would be a fantastic employee anywhere
but who has stayed with us to be a part of the farm. Thank you Chloe!
and congratulations from us all on being accepted to nursing college!
