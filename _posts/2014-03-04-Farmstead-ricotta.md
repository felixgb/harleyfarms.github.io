Our first ricotta batch of the year is in the cheese shop today. The
steamy soft scent of Salud, our chief cheesemaker, pouring the curds
into their moulds means spring to me. Early spring, with stalls of
baby goats, milking mothers, and their unbeatable milk. We use this
whole milk, frothed in a double-boiler, curdled with white wine
vinegar and a little kosher salt.

Ricotta means twice-cooked, since traditional ricotta is made from the
whey of other cheeses. We use that morning's whole milk, with a little
salt, heated to just under 200F. It should froth but not boil. Take it
off and add an acid, about a tablespoon to every cup of milk. We use
white wine vinegar, but lemon works beautifully.

Strain the curds into moulds and drain overnight. Use layers of
cheesecloth for a smoother finish. We like the firmer ricotta for
simply snacking, but if you're making pizza and want a damper ricotta,
drain for a shorter time

Don't gloat over your ricotta. Eat it. It's utterly delicious. So good
in pancakes, cheesecake, with pasta, at breakfast, any time at all
