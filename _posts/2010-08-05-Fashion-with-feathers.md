Last Friday night we papered up the barn window and lit the long table
runway for the Second Annual Fashion Show for Saviz Boutique. Saviz
has a well-cut, understated collection of sophisticated clothes which
flattered everyone - she brought some lovely young ladies to model but
allowed most of us on the runway too, proving that the clothes suit
all ages and sizes. The show ended with Saviz's own military-inspired
collection, perfectly on trend and miles from chain store anonymity.
It is such a pleasure and honor to be part of a community of local
independent businesses like Saviz's.
