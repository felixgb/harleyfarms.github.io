Just like Celebrity Baby Chloe and the Miracle Babies, Ann was not a
planned baby. She is eight weeks old and the second family of a frisky
mamma, who must have attracted the attention of our new buck Coltrane
earlier in the summer, after having her first batch of babies.

Ann is in Tony's Pen in the farm corral, and she's very friendly. She
spends a lot of time on the roof of her shelter, and without the
distraction of baby friends will probably learn how to jump into the
garden quite soon. Give her a scratch and a chat when you see her!
