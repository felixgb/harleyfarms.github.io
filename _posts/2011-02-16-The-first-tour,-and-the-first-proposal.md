It was a soft, warm February day for our first farm tour of 2011. We
had a friendly group of visitors, and most of our tour guides, to hear
the farm's history and day-to-day work schedule, to meet the pregnant
goats and watch the first babies swagger in Tony's Pen, to nibble a
fresh chevre on sourdough in the hayloft.

This is Sam, one of our most exuberant guides. On her first tour -
Valentine's weekend - a visitor proposed to his girlfriend on bended
knee, and she accepted. Everybody cried!
