Our new farm sign is up on the barn across the field from the dairy.

The farm signs are carved by folk artist Three Finger Bil, who is one
of the first people I met in California. At the time he was the
caretaker of Pigeon Point lighthouse, when it was not owned by the
state, and spent his days carving furniture and his evenings making
music with traveling musicians and the young women traveling along the
California coast. Happy days.

This is the first farm sign, with our jumpy goat. TFB keeps the signs
simple and arrestingly visual. He made the prototype of our farm goat
milk paint and painted the signs. They return to him every few years
for a fresh coat.

TFB carves our signs (and furniture) on a Pescadero ranch

This year's signs are painted in the farm paint now on sale in our
shop. This one is glossy with a rub of black soap

TFB's studio is crammed with farm projects and prototypes, plus his
plants and his ranch cats

I love this sign. You can see that the goats have nibbled the pointing
finger as they come out of the milking parlor
