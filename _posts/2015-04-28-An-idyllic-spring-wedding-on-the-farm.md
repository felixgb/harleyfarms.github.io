April means almost all of this year's babies are on the farm. There is
fresh spring milk and warm damp ricotta. The first roses and iris are
in full bloom, yet the huge carmine tea tree in our secret garden is
still dropping pink petals. It's a lovely backdrop for spring
weddings.

Bay Area stylist Karolynne Meyer designed this romantic archway for
last Saturday's wedding on the farm. Karolynne uses the farm gardens,
and her local sources, including her own huge and gorgeous garden, to
make a poignantly beautiful altar.
