It has been another magnificent year for the farm. I can't thank my
amazing staff and friends enough, and wish them all a toasty holiday
season. We're leaving tomorrow for an icy Yorkshire Christmas, and I
can't wait! Happy New Year!

Farm manager Ryan, a man who can look cool anywhere, and especially on
a barn roof. Congratulations to him and his fiancee; sorry ladies.
Thanks to Poppy de Garmo for the photo!
