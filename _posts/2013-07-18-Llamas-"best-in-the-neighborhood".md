Our four llamas, Dolly, Lorenzo, Ruby and Haley, are sheared every
year by Mr. and Mrs. Wool. The Wools have a smallholding in San Jose,
with their own sheep, horses and cow, and day jobs, but come out every
year to the coast to clip local llamas and alpacas. Shearing the heavy
wool from their abdomen in spring or early summer improves air
circulation and keeps llamas cool and comfortable. Show llamas have
special cuts, sometimes &quot;poodle&quot; or &quot;lion&quot; style,
but our working llamas are not so dressy. Depending on their
temperament, they have almost all of their wool sheared.

Dolly keeps the wool on the back of her legs because she's sensitive
to clipping there, whereas Lorenzo doesn't mind

Apparently, our llamas are the best-behaved in the neighborhood. Much
better than somebody else's alpacas!!

Mrs. Wool took the wool home and will make woolen llamas for the Farm
Shop
