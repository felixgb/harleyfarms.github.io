Yesterday was brilliantly sunny and a perfect day to try for the
ultimate photograph of our FarmPaint colors. We were thinking out of
the box of course, so the aerial helicopter camera arrived. After
strict instructions not to hover over the goats so that they all went
into premature labor, the helicam took off - but crashed into a
paddock with engine failure minutes later.

So, back to earth. We collected our giant easel and painting to pose
in front of the farm.

Never work with animals.

They want to work with you.

They will taste a new and exciting thing. And scratch their bottoms on
it

Yes! Goats approve the FarmPaint. See that scratch on the brown? That
was No. 24

And in the mustard field
