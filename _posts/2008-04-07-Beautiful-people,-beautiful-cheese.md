On Friday night we put our clean shoes on and drove a truck full of
cheese up to the city. The Cheese School of San Francisco has an
elegant upstairs room near the Embarcadero, and this was a fundraiser
for the California Artisan Cheese Guild. We're here to support fellow
cheese makers make and sell real, fabulous cheese from goat, sheep or
cow's milk.

The room had a long table of cheeses, from unctuously complex to
simply accessible, and thirty dollars bought you as much cheese and
wine as you wanted for the evening. Not surprisingly, it was packed
with beautiful people and a great success. See you at the next one!
