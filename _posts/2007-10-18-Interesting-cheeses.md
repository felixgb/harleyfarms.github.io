Even though there are so many more interesting cheeses available, we
are one of the very few farmstead producers, taking slow and
consistent steps all the way from the birth of the baby goat, to their
happy days on our pasture with its ocean breezes, to the capable hands
of our family of dairy employees, who've been with us all these nine
years. We were in Italy last year, and I gave a local foodie some of
our cheese to try, and he immediately said &quot;This cheese is made
by the ocean!&quot; It's true. You can literally taste our gorgeous
location.  OK. Enough boasting. We're working on a new, aged cheese
for spring, and so I'm getting even more excited for next year...
