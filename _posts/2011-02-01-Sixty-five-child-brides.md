Our veterinarian Dr. Andrea Mongini was back with us at the weekend to
ultrasound all of our yearling &quot;child brides&quot;. Like many
larger dairy farms, we track the pedigrees of our herd and make an
estimate of how many babies we're expecting and when they'll arrive.

Just like a human baby ultrasound.

All of our 65 yearlings and 66 mature does are pregnant. If any of the
yearlings were not pregnant, we would probably give them to families
seeking pet goats. There's virtually no possibility that they did not
have the chance to get pregnant, because bucks introduced to does on
heat take their work extremely seriously, barely pausing to eat.

Andrea was enthusiastic about the healthy condition and size of our
yearlings, which is great news for their babies and our expanding
herd, and the result of Ryan's hard work over the year. We'll raise
all the babies in the same way as Ryan raised the yearlings, in small
groups sorted by age and personality. Each baby will be tattooed on
the ear, so that we can track their pedigree over time (they mostly
get names, as well as numbers, and yes, Ryan and Annie do know them by
name!).
