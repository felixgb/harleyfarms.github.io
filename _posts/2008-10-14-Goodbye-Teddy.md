Teddy

Our dear dog Teddy died three weekends ago in her bed. She had had a
perfect day being petted on a farm tour, fetching her ball, napping in
her favorite spots and eating her dinner. She slowed down in the
evening and died with her head on my hand at 1am. Teddy was graceful
in her life and deserved no less than this peaceful end. We have moved
the fish bath from the garden for Teddy's grave, in pride of place on
the farm.  It was comforting to have my old friend Teri staying that
weekend. She was working on new artwork for the farm, which should be
unveiled soon! We sometimes have Teri's prints available in the shop -
please take a look next time you visit.
