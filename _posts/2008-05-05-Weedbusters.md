They can't wait to get at your ditch

People often ask about when we retire a milking goat. We'll keep most
of the goats for eight to ten years, and they'll live another three or
so years in retirement. So far, our elderly goats have moved next
door. Our neighbor Pattie has provided comfortable browsing and
shelter, but there won't be room for the thirty goats retiring next
year, so we have a &quot;Harley Herd&quot; plan! Our goat grannies
will be your weedbusters!! We'll be leading the retired herd to your
difficult-to-clear land, keeping them on the premises with portable
electric fencing, and polishing off the weeds, including poison oak
and bramble. The Harley Herd will start with the local ditches next
spring, and we'll let you know when they're available for you!
