The first babies of 2012 were born on Wednesday. As in previous years,
we will bottle-feed the babies ourselves in our new barn just across
the field from the farm. Farm tours will begin at the nursery barn,
where you will be able to see the babies growing in their separate
dormitories. There'll soon be babies old enough to hold in Tony's Pen
at the farm.
