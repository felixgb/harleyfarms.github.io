Annie shows a baby how to feed



Valentine's Day saw the birth of our first baby goat of 2010. The
babies are an irresistible mix of soft chocolate and mushroom browns,
white and black, and a delight to watch snoozing on their straw or
leggily staggering after one another. Perhaps a third of mothers need
a little help with birthing, an extra hand to gently tug the babies
out. We always have the liveliest older babies in Tony's Pen at
weekends, so do come and admire them close up.

Like all other best-practice dairies, we separate the babies from
their mothers shortly after birth, to make sure each kid is fed well.
The mothers have between one and four babies, and will usually feed
the strongest more than the rest. We bottle-feed each baby goat fresh,
pasteurized goat milk, and formula enhanced with vitamins and
minerals, for about six to eight weeks, until they're all at optimum
weight.

We can't help but feel regretful at taking babies from mothers, but
must follow veterinary guidelines for dairy herds, to ensure best
possible health for every goat. This way, too, we limit the spread of
complications that can show up in later life. For example, older goats
may get arthritis as a result of infections received shortly after
birth if left with their mother.

At two weeks of age, we vaccinate, dehorn and tattoo the babies with
their identifying code. We use the American Dairy Goat Association
code, to let us know the kid's mother and father. The babies will live
in &quot;Baby Goatland&quot;, separated by similar age and size into
little fenced groups of six to seven goats. The larger, more dominant
babies won't bully the weaker ones, this way, producing a more
successfully social herd.

Since we're expecting more than 200 babies, this is a lot of work! We
have a cot in the barn, and some sleepless nights ahead.
