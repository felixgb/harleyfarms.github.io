not a &quot;mistake&quot;. You know how you're never quite sure
whether a goat is pregnant or just chubby? No - just us, then? We have
December babies here. Twins, born yesterday.

Clearly, Holstein got into the wrong pen at the wrong time. We
anticipate more this week - come and see the babies, who'll be outside
in Tony's Pen for you to admire if weather permits

Most of the girls seem pregnant - or fat - we're obviously not experts

They seem docile, thoughtful; they take it easy around the loafing
barn

Others seem friskier, ready for a good time

But he's a player, so there's quite a line

Father of this week's Miracle Babies, and many more

Meanwhile, we've been cleaning out the loafing barn ready for
birthing. Goats come into the barn to give birth - they don't have
babies in the pasture

Since this ...

leads to this ...

and ultimately this, we have to rent heavy-duty equipment at this time
of year, before the ground gets waterlogged with rain, and scoop out
the barn. We dust the floor with agricultural lime to sweeten and
disinfect, and add fresh straw collected from our neighbors across the
street, the Moores

We age the manure, away from the goats. It's ideal for garden compost

Maybe we'll call this one Miracle? At least there's a clean straw bed
for them
