The bee men of Humble Bee Removal arrived on Saturday to relocate the
hive of honey bees living in our barn.

Wild bee colonies love older, lonelier buildings with holes, but these
tenants had to be rehoused! Humble Bee Removal collected the bees from
inside the interior wall and took them to another ranch further down
the coast. Hives should travel at least six to nine miles away, so
that they don't simply come back to their familiar home. These bees
were acclimatized to our coastal climate, though, so they'll be
comfortable in a similar spot not too far away.

Yum. But they weren't sharing.
