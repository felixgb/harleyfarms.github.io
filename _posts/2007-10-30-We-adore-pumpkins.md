October mornings are my very favorite time of the year. Crisp or
foggy, the smells of the farm are more intense, and there's a palpable
bustle in the air as we prepare the goats for winter. They are
beginning to put on weight for the California winter!, and so, no
doubt, will I, because we've got some delicious food planned. First,
it's pumpkin season, neighboring Half Moon Bay being the pumpkin
capital of the entire world (if the weekend traffic's anything to go
by). It's luscious added to our fromage blanc, with a tiny dusting of
cinnamon, and available now! Perfect in a cheesecake. As the dairy has
grown, I've become ever more appreciative of local foods and the
extraordinary talents of the Northern California chefs whom we've
worked with over the years. So, this Thanksgiving seemed the perfect
time to organize Fabulous Food at Harley Farms! Three top chefs will
each prepare a Thanksgiving lunch or dinner to seat 20, served under
the magnificent rafters of our old dairy barn. What better way to
celebrate family and the harvest season than on the farm, prepared by
those who love and support real food? I can't wait! Menus and booking
details on the website very soon!
