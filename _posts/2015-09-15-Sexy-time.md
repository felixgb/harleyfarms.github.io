Gate open for sexy time. This is the far less adorable beginning of
kidding season. You can't get those sweet, soft faces and first
staggering steps without the knock-out musk of bucks in rut. Here they
come.

Yes, bucks are interested in pretty much all that moves. No offense,
Mark. Generally, though, a doe on heat trumps all.

Mmm, hot boy. Bucks have scent glands behind their horns for that
chokingly pungent musk. In rut, they double down by urinating over
themselves. No such thing as subtle on goat dates. The ladies like
stinky.

Our American Alpine does are seasonal breeders, coming into heat in
the fall as the days get shorter. Individual does will come into heat
every 21 days, for anywhere from half a day to three days, until early
winter. Bucks will stay in rut for the breeding season. A doe in heat
will wag her tail wildly - flagging - and mock-mount the other does,
head-butting and bleating. Bucks will nose the urine of does on heat,
curling back their lips to inhale the telltale pheromones.

Beard stained yellow from urine spraying. It attracts the right sort
of lady

The first kids are due in five months. Goat gestation is about 150
days
