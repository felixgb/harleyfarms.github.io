Julie as the Queen and Chloe on the left in Pescadero's Chamarita
parade, last weekend

I am not one of those efficiently scheduled mothers, with whole
baseball teams of children packed into their clean cars. I know many
lovely people with large families, but our five foot eleven, fourteen-
year-old Ben seems quite enough on his own. Partly, that's because we
live in a village, and Ben and his friends have grown up in and around
each other's houses. Ben has a real presence on the farm - he feeds
both the babies and older goats, and can answer your questions with
authority. He has company, though, every weekend. We've known Jessica,
our office manager Sharina's daughter, since she was tiny, and she's
often at the farm. There's Chloe, too, who perfected her Spanish
working on the till at the gas station and tacqueria in town, and is
all charm in our shop. Julie, sixteen like Chloe and a fantastic
singer, works in the office. Occasionally, there's the very reserved
Felix, just to throw an extra English accent into the mix. Roisin,
ten, makes our folk art wool designs. And our series of goat cards
were photographed and designed by sisters Claudia and Ellen. Claudia's
twelve, but she's got all the poise and style she'll ever need. You
may meet Fiona and Carina, too, if you're visiting Tony's pen at the
weekends. The girls are local nine-year-olds who like to manage our
petting time with the babies. I know, it sounds like a child labor
camp! - but they're talented and reliable, and I don't even have to
feed them.
