I have always wanted a bonfire night. Growing up, we always had a
village bonfire on the night of the Fifth, with fireworks, a guy to
burn, potatoes wrapped in foil roasting in the fire, and sticky parkin
cake. It's traditional!

Guy Fawkes Night is the Fifth of November. The British commemorate the
failed assassination plot of 1605 to blow up King James I at the State
Opening of the Houses of Parliament with bonfires across the country.
Guy Fawkes, the conspirator who was to light the fuse, was betrayed in
the nick of time and convicted of treason. Every British village makes
guys to burn on our November Fifth bonfires. Thank you to the amazing
Heather Gibbons for this year's 18-feet tall effigy!

Dinner was autumnal comfort food, with soup, spicy macaroni cheese,
and beef stew with garlic smashed potatoes

Sweet things traditionally served on Guy Fawkes Night. Parkin (top) is
a light gingerbread. Toffee apples are compulsory

Despite last week's shower, the fields are dry. We couldn't build the
enormous bonfire of our dreams, just a warming fire
