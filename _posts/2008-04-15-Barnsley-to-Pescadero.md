I may call Richard Branson soon, to request a small, but luxurious,
direct flight from Old Royston to SFO. Tony, followed by Andrew, one
half of my fabulous house designers, has now been followed by my
father, Laurence. He'll overlap for a week with Tony, who returns in
May. There is a Busy List for my dad, and Tony. They are wonderful at
making farm structures, and competent in finishing the thousands of
small jobs ' picking up basil, chicken feed, the new broom..  This
week's building involves three new 'chicken tractors'? for our hens.
Now that the pastures are dry, we're moving these mobile hen palaces
out to the field. Designed by Three-Fingered Bil, they are both
spacious, five-star accommodation and mini-Alp play structures for the
goats.

As you may not know, the village of Royston, Barnsley, south
Yorkshire, is picturesque and has a very successful nearby soccer
team. So we're lucky to have them!
