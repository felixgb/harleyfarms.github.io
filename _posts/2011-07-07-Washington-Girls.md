Good-bye, thank you and love to our Washington Girls! Angela and
Lauren are high-school friends from Washington who came for the second
year running to stay, work, and work some more, on their California
tans. They spent three weeks working on the farm for Adriana, our
events manager, and for Joe, our farm cook.

Angela on the left, and Lauren on the right. Angela wants to work in
the hospitality business, so this was perfect experience. Lauren wants
to serve in the Peace Corps before becoming a nurse. Here she's
describing how she clutched a baby goat when she was five, the first
time she came to the farm. I met Lauren's father when I was pretty
much her age, working on a &quot;pirate ship&quot; as sailing camp
staff. Her aunt is Teri, our farm artist

Before they came last year, Lauren had never eaten any cheese. But
today, when they get home, Angela and Lauren are going to cook goat
cheese ravioli for their families. They've worked long and hard with
the farm cook, and looked beautiful throughout. They loved living in
our son Ben's cabin, they loved eating family-style at night, and they
loved Santa Cruz. We loved them! So good luck, Angela, in your move to
Massachusetts, but see you both back next year! xoxoxo
