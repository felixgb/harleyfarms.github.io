Our first baby of 2011 was born last weekend. She is that luckiest of
combinations: a single, female kid. Lucky for her because she got all
her mother's resources and will be big and healthy, lucky for us
because we keep our does and sell our bucks.

Primavera, our first baby of 2011. Her mother is Unicorn, named for
obvious reason - she's magical - and her father is Elvis. Primavera
takes after Elvis in coloring



We are bottle-feeding Primavera with her mother's colostrum, before
weaning her to goat-milk formula. Primavera will grow up with the next
few girls to be born, raised by Annie at our Baby Goatland annex,
before returning to the farm to begin their summer on our pastures.
Primavera's mother, Unicorn, is back with the pregnant older goats,
marked with a band so that we remember to milk her by hand to obtain
that precious first milk, full of nutrients and antibodies for the
babies.

Rachel teaches Primavera to suckle Unicorn's colostrum. The baby's fur
is damp from dribbling her milk at first, but she becomes adept very
quickly, and will learn to drink from teats on a bucket of formula
soon
