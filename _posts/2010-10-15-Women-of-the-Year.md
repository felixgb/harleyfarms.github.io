From left: Janet, Chloe, Lesa, me, my mother Molly, and Eilis. Even
though he has a strong feminine side, Joe our cook declined to be in
this photo. He did however drive us there and back and played Barry
Manilow loudly

Last Thursday night was the 2010 Women's Initiative Woman Entrepreneur
of the Year Award Ceremony for Silicon Valley and the Peninsula,
California. There were thirteen awards this year, for businesses
ranging from a school for children with movement disorders to dog day
care. We each brought family and friends to an evening of dinner and
short, poignant speeches.

On the right is award-winner Jesse Ziff Cool, owner and chef at the
Flea Street Cafe. Jesse's philosophy? The customer comes last, after
passionate attention to gloriously-cooked and sustainably farmed
organic food. Jesse is a hero, for her dedication to real food and her
gusto in bringing nurturing food to Stanford Hospital and in gardening
and cooking projects with local elementary schools. Jesse began her
organic restauranteur and cookery book career in 1975, when her kids
&quot;wished she was more like Betty Crocker&quot;, but now she's
absolutely mainstream.

&quot;Women of the Year&quot; is the headline, but our farm depends
upon everybody, from the milkers to the cheesemakers to the tour
guides, the farm manager and the farm cook. All our awards reflect the
Harley Farms community.
