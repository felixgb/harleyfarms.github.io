I apologize for the tardy blog update.  Spring is always busy on the
farm and, alas, this blog fell between the cracks. But I am back! I
have entered eleven of our cheeses into the American Cheese Society
Competition (see link below) which will be held in Vermont from August
1st through the 4th.  My family will join me and we will drive to
Quebec to visit some Farms and Cheese Makers before returning on the
9th. Check our new weekly feature 'week link'? for some goat giggles
and take a browse around our updated web site.  Keep checking in to
see new pictures of the farm, goats and cheese making. The weekly
tours of the summer are filling up fast so make reservations soon if
you want to get a behind the scenes look at the workings of Harley
Farms. We will try and update this blog each Friday. Bye for now. --
