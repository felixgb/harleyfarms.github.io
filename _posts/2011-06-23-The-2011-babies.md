All our 2011 babies are home. After they were born on the farm, we
took all the girls to our annex to raise them in small groups in quiet
surroundings. Ryan and Annie bottle-fed the tiny girls as they
arrived, gradually promoting them to age-appropriate milks in their
separate enclosures. Now, in June, all the babies are weaned and
eating grain and alfalfa. They came back to the farm in the truck,
packed in there one by one, and we let them loose on grass for the
first time.

Rachel tucked them into the back of the truck. The 2011 babies all
have red tags
