We've had six weeks of delightful and maybe a little frantic
preparation for a Pescadero wedding in the farm wild garden this past
weekend, with dinner and dancing in the farm barn. Six weeks of
building a new bridge over the creek in the garden, because the last
one was washed away this winter, of mowing and weeding and uncovering
the garden, which has wild rambles of old roses, hydrangeas, and
fuchsias. The wedding party sat down to dinner on benches painted in
our farm paint, at a long table on a straw-strewn floor, and watched
the moon rise on a perfect April evening.

Welcome to our romantic wild garden. Listen to the birds and leave the
world behind
