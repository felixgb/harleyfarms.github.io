Enjoy our freshly-plumbed running rainwater sink next to the farm
porta-potties!

Life gets ever more comfortable. We expect public lavatories
everywhere we go. At the farm, we installed an incineration toilet for
staff and visitors, but users fluffed the unfamiliar sequence of
events once too often, and the toilet broke down. Since the county
permit process for building a flush toilet here in Pescadero is too
long and expensive to contemplate, we now have two porta-potties
behind the loafing barn. Last week, we added a rainwater sink next to
the porta-potties, so that you may wash your hands immediately.

Our farm does not have flushing china fixtures, but we do have several
hundred healthy animals, international award-winning cheese, a farm
shop, hugely popular farm dinnersÂ  - and dedicated, talented and
highly sanitary staff
