Celebrating our Silver at the 2008 World Cheese Awards!

We gave away our winning cheese, the fromage blanc with garlic and
herbs, at the Half Moon Bay farmers' market

Bart about to have his fur, teeth and nails inspected by John Mahr

John claimed ours were among the best-behaved llamas in the county...

And it was Luis's twenty-fourth birthday!!
