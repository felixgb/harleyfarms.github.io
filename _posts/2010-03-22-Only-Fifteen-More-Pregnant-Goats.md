We've been running around like crazy, but this season's birthing has
gone well and there's plenty of spring milk!

Maggie, our Red No. 13, and her ten-minute-old baby

Maggie was born the year Ryan joined the farm. Ryan was showing a
party of schoolchildren into the barn just after her birth. One
particular child wanted to know what we would call the kid. We don't
name all the goats, but Ryan has a lot of flair with ladies, so he
naturally named the goat after the child. So, Maggie, if you're
reading this, your namesake is well and has just given birth to her
first baby of 2010, a little girl. Maggie the goat and several other
mothers follow Ryan, or bleat for his attention, just before giving
birth. They want his company as they go into labor. Popular with all
the ladies!

All the baby girls are housed in the starter shacks of BabyGoatLand,
each group according to size and personality. There'll probably be
sixteen or so groups by the end of April. We've had amazing help from
friends, and we're making the spring cheeses of 2010, so do come and
visit soon.
