One hundred babies have arrived, with only nine more pregnant Blue
Herd mothers. There is enough milk now to feed the newborns and to
begin making cheese this week. We will have a couple of weeks to catch
our breath - and bottle-feed - before the next clutch of babies
arrive. It's been our smoothest season yet, with only tiny Sunshine,
born frail and half-blind, needing special care. Happily, our friend
Sande has not only cooked for us every day but nurses Sunshine with
love and massages.

Blue Herd mummy Bernadette had the prettiest babies, with white, brown
and black coats

The baby girls who can drink from teats on a bucket are in a line of
little pens at our Big Barn. As soon as the oldest group learn a new
game, like hilariously running at top speed into the plastic wall you
see at the end of this pen, the next group copy them, and so on. Until
all forty baby girls are running into the wall!

Kevin, who is raising our baby girls in his off season, points out the
obvious joy of working with mammals rather than his birds. The kids
love to be touched and respond very happily to attention

Dirty boys. We have a new water tank, so Jake and Sean Og shovelled
out a river of mud from the old redwood tank this week
