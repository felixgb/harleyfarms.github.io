On a milking farm, male animals mostly leave. But on Friday we
welcomed two boys who'll be with us for a decade or more. They are
llamas Ruby and Haley, who belonged for 15 years to the family who
gave us Bart, our iconic black llama. Bart died almost a year and a
half ago, aged 28.

Ruby on the left, Haley on the right. They were show llamas, and have
showbiz names, but we've shortened them for their new career as goat
guardians. They will shepherd the younger milking goats

Ruby is certainly one of the most elegant llamas we've met
