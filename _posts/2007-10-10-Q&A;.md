Thank you all for the interest and questions! No, Ben didn't win his
game, but he played really well and the team had a great season. The
farm too has had a wonderful year. Several visitors have asked what
the American Cheese Society awards mean to us, since we've been
recognized each of the nine years Harley Farms has entered cheese in
this national competition. I'd say that this year, more than ever,
we're incredibly excited and grateful to have won six awards for the
11 cheeses that we entered. We saw over 1200 entries for cheeses this
year, from all over the United States. There's been an explosion of
interest in food over the past three years, with the popularity of the
Food Channel, and markets such as Wholefoods, and, in particular,
farmers' markets. Did you know that Google hosts a farmers' market for
its employees every week? We're going to visit them - with a goat! -
this month. I'll let you know how that goes!
