Pet goats Big Boy (one of our most enormous babies) and Armpit are
kept men, trained to pull a cart. They are castrated, so that they
don't bother the milking goats, but they do have their horns, because
goats sweat through their horns. There is no need for the milking
goats to keep their horns because they lead a pampered lifestyle on
the pasture, but the boys are put to work occasionally. This week they
are in the orchard eating the undergrowth.

Big Boy. Sweet-tempered

Armpit and Big Boy are more than a handful - they can easily drag a
six-foot man to the ground - and will need shepherding if we are to
move them about on the farm as weed-eaters. They will be joined by our
six hermaphrodite goats (it's quite common) to make an efficient
weeding team in the orchard, once we have a mobile solar-powered fence
in there. Goats are greedy, and can eat almost all weeds, so they are
perfect for keeping bramble, poison oak and worse under control.

Armpit. Unpredictable
