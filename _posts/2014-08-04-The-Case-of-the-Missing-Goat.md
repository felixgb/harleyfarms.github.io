&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes as I rose from the
tea tray to seek my newspaper, &quot;kindly draw the blinds if you
will.&quot; Looking down into the dusty summer traffic of our London
street, I saw a tall woman in a faded cotton cap and wellworn clogs
staring in a thoughtful fashion at our windows, her fingers hooked
into the belt of her decidedly unmodish jean trousers. I had hardly
reached the fireplace before there was a firm tap at the door. Holmes
welcomed our visitor with his usual courtesy. &quot;Do you not find,
Miss Harley, the city in August a welcome respite from farm
life?&quot;

&quot;Indeed, Mr Holmes, I cannot agree with you,&quot; our visitor
began, before breaking off with a startled frown. &quot;How can you
know this about me?&quot; &quot;It is my business to know these
things,&quot; Holmes chuckled. &quot;Perhaps I notice more than
most.&quot;

this isn't the missing goat

With widened eyes, Miss Harley recounted her tale. When she was
finished, Holmes remarked &quot;The bigger the crime, the more obvious
the motive. Such cases are of little interest. In your case, Miss
Harley, I suspect deep waters. Watson, kindly examine the bus
timetable. I believe there is a SamTrans 6.05pm to Pescadero.&quot;
