We had an astonishing morning with the second grade from Woodside
Elementary. It was bright and a little cold, the babies were
sunbathing against the barn, the mothers were out on the pasture, and
the tour went as usual, until we came to the loafing barn.

An idyllic April morning

The most complete nest we've found on the farm

Goats generally tear their nests apart after giving birth, both to eat
and to cover their newborns, but a first-time mother had been
disturbed before she could destroy her nest. This is the first time
we've ever seen such a relatively intact nest in the barn, and it was
a lucky coincidence that we had the second-graders on the farm this
very morning. There was a clutch of eggs, some with their prototype
horns visible (these are the males). We were able to take small groups
of children up close, although vibrations could disturb the hatching
eggs. We'll keep an eye on them throughout the day, because the errant
mother is unlikely to return now that we've discovered her nest.
Hopefully, some of the eggs will hatch in the warmth of the afternoon
sun. One of the children thought he saw some movement, so fingers
crossed for baby goats today!!
