Last year, Trisha and Rob stood on the hayloft balcony overlooking the
farm and said I want it. They booked their wedding on the spot. We had
taken them into the secret garden with the huge tea tree in full rich
blossom, and I think it was the color for Trisha, who loves the
opulence of rich wines, orange and purples.

We try to book Bay Area stylist Karolynne Meyer for weddings on the
farm. She thinks big, and we like it. Karolynne arrived at 8am on the
day of the wedding with a truckload of flowers. We always use local
and seasonal bloom from the farm gardens and hedgerows, together with
Karolynne's own flowers, and additional loveliness as requested by the
bride. If you would like out of season blossoms, you will have them -
it's your day.

Trisha's bouquet was a luscious combination of deeply fragrant sweet
peas and dramatically orange protea and kangaroo paws.

Flowers for the wedding feast upstairs in the hayloft were next. Our
overflowing dramatic arrangements are English-style -Â  wildly
romantic and atmospheric.

Karolynne decorated the hayloft balcony with more vibrant oranges and
purples to add even more romance to wedding photographs.

Choose simply drinks with cheese or both cheese and hot tasty nibbles
for your guests outside.

Wedding style for farm weddings is tricky but we think these young
people look absolutely adorable.
