We are so pleased to have already sold many of our 2011 Farm Dinners,
praised by Sunset Magazine as one of their top three farm dinner
choices. We have to thank our magnificent cook, Joe, and his team,
whose  efforts are superlative. The sound of energetic hand-whipping
of a  dreamy pumpkin mousse drifted out from the kitchen for several
minutes  as I watered the garden last week.   We also have to thank my
husband. He and sister Kathy are the fourth  generation to work in our
local family restaurant. My father-in-law  governs the restaurant's
huge, well-ordered vegetable garden; my husband  hadn't gardened
seriously until this summer, when his bad back kept him  awake at
nights. He spent those wakeful, moon-lit nights with our own
vegetables, and they blossomed.

We have had beans, carrots, beets,  squash, lettuces, leafy greens and
herbs like never before. The farm  kitchen cooks almost every weekend,
sometimes for large private parties,  and for all our Farm Dinners,
but will not run out of just-picked  vegetables, raised on the
&quot;black gold&quot; of our pasture soil and  well-rotted goat
manure.

I am from Yorkshire, where we have the National Vegetable Society,
which advances &quot;the culture, study and improvement of
vegetables&quot;. We  grow monster veg, and compete at horticultural
shows for the biggest  parsnip in town. My husband grew up with food
and vegetable gardening,  and it's all about flavor for him. We leave
the monster bragging to the  pumpkin growers! Check out our Farm
Dinner dates, and come and taste our  farm vegetables next year.
