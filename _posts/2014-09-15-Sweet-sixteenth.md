Every year we donate one event in our hayloft and garden. This year we
were absolutely delighted to host Puente's 16th anniversary party on
Sunday afternoon, with appetizers from the farm kitchen.

Puente de la Costa Sur is the community resource center for the South
Coast, providing food, transportation, shelter referrals, housing
assistance,  advocacy, and health, literacy, and education services
for local residents.

Anna-Lesa made pizzas of local sausage and tomatoes with our feta
cheese

although there wasn't much to tidy up. Congratulations to Puente on 16
years of community support!
