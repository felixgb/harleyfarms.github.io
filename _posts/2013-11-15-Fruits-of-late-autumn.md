Still no rain. None in the forecast. Dust, not mud. Stiff upper lip -
we just have to carry on enjoying autumn. The cheese shop has baskets
of persimmons brought in from Meryl's tree. She has the fuyu variety -
the less astringent kind which you can eat like an apple when it's
still firm, slice into salads when it's a little riper, or leave to
soften if you fancy persimmon pudding.

If you have a persimmon tree, you will be giving them away by the
boxful. They will ripen off the tree

These ones in the kitchen look almost ripe - if you can pull the calyx
out easily, they are ready to eat, and you can spoon the flesh out
from the skin. I don't know what the cook has planned for these. Like
quince, fuyu persimmon will work well with meat, too

Quince grows well in Pescadero and there are several trees in town,
enough quince for everybody. Bring the windfall quinces inside for
their glorious scent

Deer have eaten all the apple leaves in reach. We plan to lease some
of the garden - the old restaurant vegetable garden on the way into
the secret garden - and will have to fence to keep the deer away from
luscious crops

Still no rain, but an excellent crop of flower seeds. We save our
sunflowers, nigella, cosmos, cleome and tithonia
