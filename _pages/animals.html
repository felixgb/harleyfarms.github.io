        Harley Farms is one of the very few farmstead dairies in the United States. We raise milking goats and make cheese from their milk on the farm. This way, we manage every aspect of the outstanding taste of our cheeses.

         ### Alpine goats

         Dee’s first six goats were American Alpines, and today’s herd are their descendants. American Alpines are a hardy, exceptionally agile breed with a gentle and curious temperament. They are an excellent milking breed, producing relatively high quantities of milk that is high in butterfat and protein, ideal for making cheese. We milk once a day, first thing. Each goat will produce a gallon of milk a day. That gallon makes one pound of cheese.

         Our herd of American Alpine goats are separated by age. The mature goats are milked twice a day, at 5am and 5pm. Each goat will produce a gallon of milk a day. That gallon makes one pound of cheese.

         We begin breeding in fall, and babies arrive from mid-February to late May.
