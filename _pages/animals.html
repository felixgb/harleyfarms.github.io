        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Farm animals</h2>

        Harley Farms is one of the very few farmstead dairies in the United States. We raise milking goats and make cheese from their milk on the farm. This way, we manage every aspect of the outstanding taste of our cheeses.

         ### Alpine goats

         Dee's first six goats were American Alpines, and today's herd are their descendants. American Alpines are a hardy, exceptionally agile breed with a gentle and curious temperament. They are an excellent milking breed, with a high yield of milk rich in butterfat and protein, which is ideal for making cheese.

         We milk the mature goats once a day, first thing. Each goat will produce a gallon of milk a day. That gallon makes one pound of cheese.

         We begin breeding and stop milking in fall, and babies arrive from mid-February to late May.

                        <h2>Rosie the donkey</h2>We adopted Rosie in 2014. She enjoys the company of the younger goats, though not necessarily the bucks. Rosie will look at you with a pleading, hungry face, but please resist feeding her your picnic. She is much too fat and needs a strict diet and plenty of walks. When the path is not sodden, we take her for evening walks through the farm Secret Garden. She is training to lead a donkey cart, and starred in the 2016 Palm Sunday parade in Redwood City.

                          <h2>Bees</h2>The beehives are in our orchard on the path to the Secret Garden, so that the bees have miles of protected foraging space. Our farming neighbors have a field of organic mint alongside our garden. Farm honey makes a sweet wedding favor.
