        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Cheese from a tasty town</h2>

        When you take a bite of our fresh goat milk cheese, you bite into a hundred years of dairy farming. You taste the grasses in our pasture, the milk of our alpine goats, the salt breeze of our California coastal town. Even if all you taste is a fresh, mildly tangy cheese, be assured that experts taste all the above!

        We are one of the few farmstead dairies in the United States, and we remain a small, community-orientated business. We are therefore proud to hold over thirty national awards from the American Cheese Society.

        In 2014, thanks to our cheesemakers, our dairy and farm staff, and our goats, we won an international Gold Medal at the World Cheese Awards for our Monet cheese.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The farm never stops</h3>

        Our farm manager arrives at six in the morning, and the cheesemakers at eight o'clock. The warm milk is pasteurized in the dairy by one of our three staff with pasteurization licenses. The cheesemakers add culture and vegetable rennet, and the milk curdles overnight. The curds then drain for at least another day in cheesecloth bags. We salt and cool the cheeses before packing them into our molds and adding herbs, spices or flowers.

        We produce four styles of fresh goat milk cheese: chevre, fromage blanc, feta, and ricotta. We also make a mature cheese, but it is not yet ready for you.

         ### Chevre

         Chevre is the French word for cheese made with goat's milk. It can be soft or hard, fresh or aged. The Harley Farms chevre is a fresh, semi-soft cheese with a classic mild tangy taste. We pasteurize chevre and fromage blanc at the lowest possible temperature, raising the milk slowly to full heat, holding it there for 30 minutes, and then dropping the temperature slowly. This way, we retain a relatively high nutritional content. Chevre drains for two days.

         ### Feta
         
         Feta is a crumbly, creamy cheese, aged in brine for a year. We begin batches in the spring. We take 50 gallons at a time, curdling the milk to a stiff yoghurt, which the cheesemakers cut into curds. They hand-stir the cut curds slowly and gently, to release more whey but not break up the squares. The curds then drain in stainless steel basket molds under pressure overnight.

         In the morning, the cheesemakers cut these firm curds into two-pound pieces, sprinkle each side with kosher salt, and drain them to a desirably dry, crumbly texture, before brining them for twelve months.

         We cut the feta to size for the shop, and sell out almost immediately.

         ### Ricotta
         
         Our ricotta is a whole-milk, semi-solid curd cheese. It is a pleasure to make in the dairy, or at home. Whole milk is frothed in a double-boiler, curdled with white wine vinegar and a little kosher salt, scooped into one-pound baskets and drained overnight. Both ricotta and feta are a seasonal delight, for you can easily taste the sweetness of freshly grown grass in spring cheese.

         We use our ricotta in our sensational raviolis, which are often on farm dinner menus. You could also drizzle the fresh ricotta with honey for breakfast or dessert.

         ### Fromage blanc
         
         Fromage blanc is a fresh, soft cheese. Our fromage blanc is pasteurized slowly like our chevre, but the curds are drained for a shorter time, producing a tangier cheese with a whipped, creamy consistency.

         Because it contains more whey, fromage blanc is higher in protein than chevre and less suitable for heating. Use chevre in your baking, and indulge in fromage blanc as a delicious straight from the tub snack at any time. Fromage blanc is almost fat-free.

         ### Edible flowers
         
         Our chevre with herbes de Provence, seeds and edible petals holds an international gold medal. These varieties of calendula, borage, viola, salvia, pinks and cornflower have centuries of kitchen and medicinal history. We grow them here in our small edible-flower garden overlooked by the hayloft balcony.
