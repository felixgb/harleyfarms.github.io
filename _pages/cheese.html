        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Cheese from a tasty town</h2>

        When you take a bite of our fresh goat milk cheese, you bite into a hundred years of dairy farming. You taste the grasses in our pasture, the milk of our alpine goats, the salt breeze of our California coastal town. Even if all you taste is a fresh, mildly tangy cheese, be assured that experts taste all the above!

        We are one of the few farmstead dairies in the United States, and we remain a small, community-orientated business. We are therefore proud to hold over thirty national awards from the American Cheese Society.

        In 2014, thanks to our cheesemakers, our dairy and farm staff, and our goats, we won an international Gold Medal at the World Cheese Awards for our Monet cheese.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The farm never stops</h3>

        Our milking staff arrive at five-thirty in the morning, and the cheesemakers at eight o'clock. The warm milk is pasteurized in the dairy by one of our three staff with pasteurization licenses. The cheesemakers add culture and vegetable rennet, and the milk curdles overnight. The curds then drain for at least another day in cheesecloth bags. We salt and cool the cheeses before packing them into our molds and adding herbs, spices or flowers.

        We produce four styles of fresh goat milk cheese: chevre, fromage blanc, feta, and ricotta. We also make a mature cheese, but it is not yet ready for you.

         ### Chevre

         We pasteurize chevre and fromage blanc at the lowest possible temperature, raising the milk slowly to full heat, holding it there for 30 minutes, and then dropping the temperature slowly. This way, we retain a relatively high nutritional content. Chevre drains for two days.

         ### Feta
         
         We make small brine-soaked batches of feta in the spring. We take 50 gallons at a time, adding more culture and rennet than the soft cheeses and holding the batch at a different temperature. The milk curdles to a stiff yoghurt, which the cheesemakers cut into one-inch squares and drain for 30 minutes. They hand-stir the cut curds slowly and gently, to release more whey but not break up the squares. The curds then drain in stainless steel basket molds under pressure overnight.

         In the morning, the cheesemakers cut these firm curds into two-pound pieces, sprinkle each side with kosher salt, and stash them in the cooler for two days, to drain off more whey and reach a desirably dry, crumbly texture.

         The fetas are then stored in buckets of 25% salt brine for two months, and then relieved of some of this salt in a 4% brine for three or four days. We cut them to size for the shop, and sell out almost immediately.

         ### Ricotta
         
         Ricotta is a pleasure to make in the dairy, or at home. Whole milk is frothed in a double-boiler, curdled with white wine vinegar and a little kosher salt, scooped into one-pound baskets and drained overnight. Both ricotta and feta are a seasonal delight, for you can easily taste the sweetness of freshly grown grass in spring cheese.

         We use our ricotta in our sensational raviolis, which are often on farm dinner menus. You could also drizzle the fresh ricotta with honey for breakfast or dessert.

         ### Fromage blanc
         
         Our fromage blanc is pasteurized slowly like our chevre, but the curds are drained for a shorter time, producing a tangier cheese with a whipped, creamy consistency.

         Because it contains more whey, fromage blanc is higher in protein than chevre and less suitable for heating.

         ### Edible flowers
         
         Our chevre with herbes de Provence, seeds and edible petals holds an international gold medal. These varieties of calendula, borage, viola, salvia, pinks and cornflower have centuries of kitchen and medicinal history. We grow them here in our small edible-flower garden overlooked by the hayloft balcony.
