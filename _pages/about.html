        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Harley farms</h2>

        The Harley Farms team includes three cheesemakers, a goatherd, a farm manager and a farm cook. Our mission is to provide food and an experience that is truly sustainable and local for our community and visitors. We pride ourselves on the integrity of our water use, diversification, and good citizenry.

        Harley Farms is open year-round for farm and dairy tours, retreats, and events in our atmospheric hayloft. Tour visitors see a working farm, and watch the milk move from goat to dairy, from curd to cheese. The farm is open during the winter months from 11am to 3pm Monday-Thursday, and from 10am to 4 pm Friday-Sunday, for unscheduled visits.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">What can I do if I'm not with a tour group?</h3>

        Visitors may stroll into the farm to see goats and llamas in paddocks and pastures. In the spring, there are often lively babies in Tony's Pen. Don't miss the hayloft with our magnificent fir table and carved chairs, where we host parties and farm dinners. The Cheese Shop at the dairy, open from 10 to 5, features our award-winning ricotta, feta, chevre and fromage blanc cheeses, plus a luxurious range of goat milk lotions and soaps, jellies and honey. Make a picnic basket and relax at our tables.

         ### Our history

         Deborah Harley is a Yorkshirewoman lucky enough to have found Pescadero in her twenties. The farm grew from Dee's six pet goats to today's herd, with their delicious, critically-acclaimed cheese. Today, the farm team includes three cheesemakers, a goatherd, a farm manager and a cook. The Harley Farms chevre, fromage blanc, ricotta and feta cheeses have been consistent winners at the American Cheese Society awards, and hold three international World Cheese Show medals.

         ### Pescadero
         
         Harley Farms is in Pescadero, an agricultural village two miles inland from the magnificent Californian coast. Birds flock over our seawater estuary, fields of brussels sprouts, leeks and rosemary line our country roads, and local farmers gossip over coffee or kombucha in our lively downtown.

            ### Did you know?

            Goats are full of gentle curiosity and playfulness - and will spot an open gate in seconds. This is our third decade raising goats, and we're still enchanted by spring babies and surprised by goat behavior and genetics. Here we try to answer some popular questions about the farm.

            ### Farm news

            These stories are all true, about real people on the farm. There's Three Finger Bil, who made our immense hayloft table and all the farm signs. Stern matriarch Salud, who is essentially the boss. Ruby and Haley the showbiz llamas. The German hitchhikers who built the chicken tractor. Rosie the donkey and her surprise reunion with her original owners. I hope you enjoy our farm news.
