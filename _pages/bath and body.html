            ### Face cream

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">The Rolls-Royce of our range, the billy-goat of our herd, our Face Cream is the magnificent goat milk product we want you to try first. Unscented, mild and delightful to the touch, it vanishes into your skin on its way to moisturize and protect you. Fresh goat milk, accompanied by natural oils, butters, rose water and vitamin C, working wonders. The more youthful-appearing, frankly prettier, you will thank us for this luxury. 1.35oz jar</p>

            ### Facial cleanser

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">I wish I could take more time out of the day to just stop and smell the roses. Those moments for yourself are precious, and I don't seem to fit them into the day as much as I'd like. So my face wash at dawn and dusk is a very precious routine for me. Goat milk is supremely gentle to facial skin because it has a pH very close to that of our skin, and is easily absorbed for extra moisture. We added raw local honey for its soothing antiseptic and antimicrobial attributes, blended with rose water, natural oils and shea butter, to make our Milk and Honey Facial Cleanser. Wash your face gently twice a day, with the very best of sustainably produced all-natural ingredients, and take time to smell the roses! 4oz bottle</p>

            ### Facial tonic

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Your face may be a window into your soul, but actually your skin tells a better story. Dehydration from too much time outdoors or inside, blemishes from bacteria on a phone or keyboard, lines from stress and lack of sleep. Pretty on the outside may not lead to pretty on the inside, but make a start! Wipe off the make-up, wash off the dirt with clean hands, pat dry with a clean towel, and spritz with toner. Our gentle rose and orange blossom water facial tonic works with our Milk and Honey Facial Cleanser to bolster your skin's natural barrier, moisturizing, calming and protecting your face. Contains immortelle essential oil to soothe inflammation and pamper your soul. 4oz bottle</p>

            ### Eye cream

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">We have won two world medals for cheese. If we were to chose a bath and body product to compete internationally, it would be our Carrot Seed Oil Eye Cream. A faint golden-cream color, this eye cream melts into your most delicate skin on touch without smear or oily gleam, delivering soothing protection from age and the environment. This is the essence of luxury: world-class effective ingredients, hand-made with a sustainable harvest in mind. 0.5oz jar</p>

            ### Lip treatment

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">We spend a lot of time outdoors, so it's essential to have a nourishing lip balm on hand. Our peppermint balm is a moisturizing blend of jojoba and other oils, beeswax, mango and other butters. 0.35oz jar</p>

            ### Lotion

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Our elegant range of goat milk lotions, made locally with our fresh milk and aromatic lemon or lavender essential oils, are so alluringly packaged with our jumpy goat logo that you'll have a hard time giving these away. Nevertheless, these delicate, handmade luxuries make very desirable presents. Your skin will lap up their creamy lightness; you'll love the aromatic, silky finish. 8oz bottle</p>

            ### Hand salve

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">When I was growing up in Yorkshire, the powerful throat lozenges known as Fishermen's Friends were extremely popular for sore throats. These are an all-natural concoction made with liquorice, menthol and eucalyptus oil, originally for deep-sea fishermen off Iceland, who found them so effective they nicknamed the lozenges "Friends". Well, Pescadero isn't quite as bitter as oceans off Iceland, but day after day outside on the farm takes a toll on skin. Our Hand Salve is truly a farmer's friend. 7oz tin</p>

            ### Bar soap

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Our fresh goat milk soap is handmade locally in small batches, aged to produce a premium soap that keeps its form and delicate aroma of lemon verbena, lavender, citrus spice or nothing at all. We use this soap every day on the farm and at home, because there's nothing better than this traditional recipe of fresh goat milk and oils on hardworking skin. You'll enjoy a luscious lather, enriched, happier skin, and the pleasure of using a well-made, everyday luxury. Beautifully boxed with our jumpy goat logo. Minimum 4oz bar</p>

            ### Liquid soap

            If I had a cent for each time I wash my hands in the day, my mother would have a box at Wimbledon with strawberries and cream on the hour, every hour. Cuddling a baby goat, collecting the eggs, setting the table, milking the goats: everybody's hands have to be supremely clean without stripping the protective oils from our skin, which means scrubbing with a gentle but effective soap for at least 20 seconds each time we wash. The farm Liquid Soap, made to the same exacting standards as the rest of our Bath and Body range, is at each sink in my house and garden. 8oz bottle

            ### Baby bum balm

            A tender, all-natural balm for tender, all-natural bottoms. You may not have three hundred baby goats to tend, but you do have your own baby's delicate bottom to protect? Our balm is a gently effective salve of moisturizing oils and unrefined shea butter, with calendula absolute to soothe irritated or inflamed skin. Like everything in our bath and body range, hand-made with a sustainable harvest in mind. 2oz tub
