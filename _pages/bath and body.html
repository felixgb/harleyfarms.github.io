            ### Eye cream

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">We have won two world medals for cheese. If we were to chose a bath and body product to compete internationally, it would be our Carrot Seed Oil Eye Cream. A faint golden-cream color, this eye cream melts into your most delicate skin on touch without smear or oily gleam, delivering soothing protection from age and the environment. This is the essence of luxury: world-class effective ingredients, hand-made with a sustainable harvest in mind. 0.5oz jar</p>

            ### Lip treatment

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">We spend a lot of time outdoors, so it's essential to have a nourishing lip balm on hand. Our peppermint balm is a moisturizing blend of jojoba and other oils, beeswax, mango and other butters. 0.35oz jar</p>

            ### Hand salve

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">When I was growing up in Yorkshire, the powerful throat lozenges known as Fishermen's Friends were extremely popular for sore throats. These are an all-natural concoction made with liquorice, menthol and eucalyptus oil, originally for deep-sea fishermen off Iceland, who found them so effective they nicknamed the lozenges "Friends". Well, Pescadero isn't quite as bitter as oceans off Iceland, but day after day outside on the farm takes a toll on skin. Our Hand Salve is truly a farmer's friend. 7oz tin</p>

            ### Bar soap

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Our fresh goat milk soap is handmade locally in small batches, aged to produce a premium soap that keeps its form and delicate aroma of lemon verbena, lavender, citrus spice or nothing at all. We use this soap every day on the farm and at home, because there's nothing better than this traditional recipe of fresh goat milk and oils on hardworking skin. You'll enjoy a luscious lather, enriched, happier skin, and the pleasure of using a well-made, everyday luxury. Beautifully boxed with our jumpy goat logo. Minimum 4oz bar</p>

            ### Baby bum balm

            A tender, all-natural balm for tender, all-natural bottoms. You may not have three hundred baby goats to tend, but you do have your own baby's delicate bottom to protect? Our balm is a gently effective salve of moisturizing oils and unrefined shea butter, with calendula absolute to soothe irritated or inflamed skin. Like everything in our bath and body range, hand-made with a sustainable harvest in mind. 2oz tub

            ### Perfect them

            Great for athletic types. Our bar soap is a soap for aficionados, aged for months to keep shape and lather, made with fresh goat milk, oils and essential oils only. Our salve gets right in there for powerful skin protection — we specify hands, but cyclists and hobbity feet would love this too. Goat milk soap and hand salve $35
