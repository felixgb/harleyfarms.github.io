        ### Private dinners
         
        We produce four styles of fresh goat milk cheese: chevre, fromage blanc, feta, and ricotta. Chevre is our main cheese.

        We pasteurize the chevre and fromage blanc at the lowest possible temperature, raising the milk slowly to full heat, holding it there for 30 minutes, and then dropping the temperature slowly. This way, we retain a relatively high nutritional content. The whey drains from the curd for two days, producing our classically fresh, consistently award-winning cheeses.

        This is placeholder copy. Your wedding ceremony will be enchanting in our secret woodland garden, a short walk from the farm. Your backdrop is the rolling hills of our lush farming valley, with our century-old evocative barns and hayloft. Toast your life together in the garden or back at the farm, with our farmstead cheeses and honey lavender lemonade.
