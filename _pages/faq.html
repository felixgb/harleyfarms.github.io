        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Weâ€™re often asked if we milk the males. Find out below.</h2>

        ### How did you get started?

        Dee Harley and her family have lived on the farm for over twenty years. By chance, Dee met Nancy Gaffney, who had a herd of about sixty goats in Davenport. Seeing the available pasture, Nancy asked if Dee would overwinter six goats. Four years later, this herd grew to include all of Nancy's goats. Nancy taught Salud how to make cheese, and retired from the goat trade. It was the perfect ending for her, and the beginning of Harley Farms.

        ### How old is the farm?

        The farm was built 103 years ago as a cow dairy farm. We celebrated the farm's centennial in 2010!

        ### How many staff do you have?

        We have a staff of about eight people and up to 22 employees, including seasonal employees, high-school students and tour guides.

        ### How many goats do you have?

        Usually around 200 goats live at the farm, in milking herds separated by age. We expect nearly 200 babies every year, starting in early March. How much milk does each goat produce? The goats who have had babies are the milking goats. About a month after giving birth, each goat will produce as much as a gallon of milk a day. We milk them throughout the year until breeding season, but their best yield is in spring after the babies are born. No! We don't milk the males, but you can try if you would like.

        ### Why don't you make aged cheeses?

        We are developing an aged cheese. Aged cheeses like cheddar need to be stored at a different temperature than that in our small storage cave. We added a separate cave for aged cheese in late 2012. We are certified to make goat milk butter and ice cream.

        ### What are those structures in the chicken run?

        We used to house some of the farm chickens in "chicken tractors", which can be moved around the pasture to fertilize the ground. These tractors have to be sturdy enough to withstand the goats, who love climbing. The tractors are now in the chicken run.

        ### Are those goat eggs in the shop?

        Yes. They are extremely rare and sell for hundreds of dollars.
