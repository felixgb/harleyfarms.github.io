        <description>Why do we bottle-feed the kids? Why not let mothers suckle their babies? Like the majority of farmstead goat dairies in the United States, we remove kids from their mothers and bottle-feed newborns with pasteurized colostrum milk. We milk the mothers, pasteurize that milk, and teach the kids to feed themselves from buckets with teats. It's tedious work, which we could avoid by leaving the kids with their mothers, at least for a few weeks.</description>
