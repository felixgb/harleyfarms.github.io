        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Tour the farm</h2>

        Harley Farms is open for farm tours and events in our atmospheric restored hayloft and larger private barns. Tours feature our goats with their guardian llamas out in their pasture and inside their loafing barn and milking parlor. Bring farm-ready footwear and be prepared to be nibbled!

        Be sure to stop in the Cheese Shop at the dairy, which features our award-winning ricotta, feta, chevre and fromage blanc cheeses, with jellies, jams, spices and herb oils from the farm kitchen. There are local farm eggs and jars of our honey, pottery and hand-carved cheese knives, and plenty of souvenir farm clothing.

        Weekend tours begin at 11am and Friday tours at 1pm, for two hours. Limited parking; no pets on the farm.

        You may book a weekend tour by clicking on the button below. For private or school tours, please contact us at 650 879 0480; please book well in advance.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What can I do if I'm not with a tour group?</h2>

        Visitors may stroll into the farm to see goats and llamas in paddocks and pastures. In the spring, there are often lively babies in Tony's Pen. Don't miss the hayloft with our magnificent fir table and carved chairs, where we host parties and farm dinners. The Cheese Shop at the dairy, open from 10 to 5, features our award-winning ricotta, feta, chevre and fromage blanc cheeses, plus a luxurious range of goat milk lotions and soaps, jellies and honey. Make a picnic basket and relax at our tables.
