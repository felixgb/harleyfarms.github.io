        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Tour the farm</h2>

        Harley Farms is open for farm tours and events in our atmospheric restored hayloft and larger private barns. Tours feature our goats with their guardian llamas out in their pasture and inside their loafing barn and milking parlor. Bring farm-ready footwear and be prepared to be nibbled!

        Be sure to stop in the Cheese Shop at the dairy, which features our award-winning ricotta, feta, chevre and fromage blanc cheeses, with jellies, jams, spices and herb oils from the farm kitchen. There are local farm eggs and jars of our honey, pottery and hand-carved cheese knives, and plenty of souvenir farm clothing.

        Weekend tours begin at 11am and Friday tours at 1pm, for two hours. Limited parking; no pets on the farm.

        You may book a weekend tour by clicking on the button below. For private or school tours, please contact us at 650 879 0480; please book well in advance.

Don't miss the hayloft with our magnificent fir table and carved chairs, where we host parties and farm dinners. The Cheese Shop at the dairy, open from 10 to 5, features our award-winning ricotta, feta, chevre and fromage blanc cheeses, plus a luxurious range of goat milk lotions and soaps, jellies and honey.

            ### Weekend family visits

            We encourage your unscheduled visits with the family. Enjoy wandering the main farm corral to watch the babies in kidding season, and check out our edible flower gardens and hayloft. There are picnic tables in the field near the donkey pen, with plenty of space for your frisky small companions.

            ### Weekend tours

Tours offer more background on dairy farming and the history of Harley Farms, and we we don't recommend them for young children (we welcome your little companions on unscheduled trips, and will have two pens with baby goats for you to visit in kidding season).
