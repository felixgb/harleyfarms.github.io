        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Join us for dinner</h2>

        These under-the-radar romantic occasions are as perfect for the jaded gourmet in your life as they are for your mother. Our tasty town of Pescadero is known nationally for excellent local foods and cooking, and this will be your intimate celebration of our bounty.

        Dinners include a visit to the goats with seasonal food, flowers and candlelight in our restored Victorian hayloft or spacious Upper Barn. Equinox and Solstice Farm Dinners feature a full tour of the farm, with live music and local winery tasting or special guests. Do bring your own bottle or two, but please leave your children under 18 years at home.

        <p style="text-align: center;">Dinner $150 per person. From 4pm<br />Luncheon $100 per person. Mostly from 12pm, sometimes 11am</p>

        If the dates below don't work for you, talk with us about a private event. It's easy to reserve a date and share the cost with friends.

            ### Spring dinners

            Valentine's Day onwards heralds our three hundred babies, born in the loafing barn under your eyes! They will melt your heart, and the seasonal sweetness of our cheeses will melt in your mouth. The lilacs are in bud, the spring grass is deep green, and the milk is at its most delicious.

            ### Summer dinners

            Summer is the season of frisky goat babies, sprawling roses and scratching chickens at Harley Farms. Our vegetable garden will be lush, and good smells will drift from our kitchen. These are the sights and scents of memories - what more pleasurable way to spend an evening than with us on the farm?

            ### Autumn dinners

            The trees alongside the creek flush yellow and umber, pumpkins and squash jostle the rhubarb and artichokes in the garden, there'll be new kittens in the haystack, and the evenings will stretch long and warmly at the farm. We'll be grilling Cornish game hens, or lamb, or skewers of farm vegetables.
