Equinox and Solstice Farm Dinners feature a full tour of the farm, with live music and local winery tasting or special guests. Do bring your own bottle or two, but please leave your children under 18 years at home.

        <p style="text-align: center;">Dinner $150 per person. From 4pm<br />Luncheon $100 per person. Mostly from 12pm, sometimes 11am</p>

            ### Spring dinners

            Valentine's Day onwards heralds our three hundred babies, born in the loafing barn under your eyes! They will melt your heart, and the seasonal sweetness of our cheeses will melt in your mouth. The lilacs are in bud, the spring grass is deep green, and the milk is at its most delicious.

            ### Summer dinners

            Summer is the season of frisky goat babies, sprawling roses and scratching chickens at Harley Farms. Our vegetable garden will be lush, and good smells will drift from our kitchen. These are the sights and scents of memories - what more pleasurable way to spend an evening than with us on the farm?

             ### Autumn dinners
 
             The trees alongside the creek flush yellow and umber, pumpkins and squash jostle the rhubarb and artichokes in the garden, there'll be new kittens in the haystack, and the evenings will stretch long and warmly at the farm. We'll be grilling Cornish game hens, or lamb, or skewers of farm vegetables.

             ### Winter dinners

             Pescadero is a community of people with practical and original talents, not least growing and cooking food. Local folk artist Three-Finger Bil made our barn furniture and iconic goatherd girls; sculptor Dan Geraci made our pizza oven and pewter goblets.

             We celebrate family, community and friends surrounded by their creativity and generous contribution. When you eat with us you will feel the spirit of a community, the essence of our tasty town.

            ### Murder-mystery dinner

            Death at the Farm. Horror in the Hayloft. One unlucky person will perish. (It won't be Cook. That's all we can reveal.) Clues will come to light. Red herrings will be served. You are the detective. Or maybe the murderer.
            Invitation to include requested attire and a description of your character. Theatricality a must. If you aren't disguised, we will murder you straightaway and put you on washing-up duty.
            Prize! You have one chance to denounce the murderer. First correct written guess receives two 2017 Harley Farms farm dinner tickets.

            ### Treasure-hunt luncheon

            Scavenger hunt in Pescadero. Play solo or in a team, your choice. After lemonade refreshment at our Upper Barn, you will receive your list of wanted treasure. Maybe we will want an artichoke. Maybe a French tourist. Maybe a photo of the highest house number in downtown Pescadero. Good luck. You will need your own transportation. We will have lunch ready for you at 1pm.
            Prize! The first person or team to present a complete or the most complete list of items will receive a pair of tickets for the 2017 Harley Farms farm dinners.

            ## Bonfire-night dinner

            Remember, remember the Fifth of November, Gunpowder treason and plot
            Guy Fawkes Night is Bonfire Night in the United Kingdom. We burn an effigy of Guy Fawkes, a political agitator caught in the act attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill King James I in 1605 - us British know how to have a party. Usually, there are fireworks (can't promise those) and comfort foods, including jacket potatoes cooked in the bonfire and toffee apples. We'll cook a more sophisticated take on winter comfort food, but there'll definitely be a bonfire.
            Includes Visit with the goats, Bonfire, and Farm Dinner in the Upper Barn

            <p style="text-align: center;">Saturday, November 5, 4pm
            <br>$150/person, Adults only</p>
