        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Join us for dinner</h2>

        These under-the-radar romantic occasions are as perfect for the jaded gourmet in your life as they are for your mother. Our tasty town of Pescadero is known nationally for excellent local foods and cooking, and this will be your intimate celebration of our bounty.

        Dinners include a visit to the goats with seasonal food, flowers and candlelight in our restored Victorian hayloft or spacious Upper Barn. Equinox and Solstice Farm Dinners feature a full tour of the farm, with live music and local winery tasting or special guests. Do bring your own bottle or two, but please leave your children under 18 years at home.

        <p style="text-align: center;">Dinner $150 per person. From 4pm<br />Luncheon $100 per person. Mostly from 12pm, sometimes 11am</p>

        If the dates below don't work for you, talk with us about a private event. It's easy to reserve a date and share the cost with friends.
