  <h1>Farm Shop</h1>
  <p class="intro">
  Picnic on the farm or take home a souvenir of Pescadero. The farm shop is in
  the old dairy stables, with horse hoof grooves in the floor. Ask our staff
  for a taste of anything you fancy and stock your pantry with some farm-made
  goodness.

        <h3>Working Animals</h3>
        <p>
          Where there is grain, there are field mice. There are several cats on
          the farm.  If you see them asleep, encourage them to get up and get
          back to work.
